Marked interval enlargement of the cardiac silhouette .\\nTogether with the interval development of bilateral pleural effusions , this indicates cardiac insufficiency ( or alternatively volume overload ) and an echocardiogram may be indicated for further evaluation .\\n2. Bilateral basilar compressive atelectasis .\\nSuperimposed infectious consolidation is likely .\\n3. Interval development of tree-in-Eric nodular opacities and scattered ground glass opacities involving the right lung , concerning for an infectious process .\\nThe differential diagnosis of this is wide including viral , fungal and atypical mycobacterial infections .\\nDrug toxicity would be a consideration , although somewhat less likely given the unilaterality of the findings .\\n4.

When his O2 saturation was monitored , his pulse oximetry remained in the 90s during his stay .\\n2. His non-essential medications that may have been contributing to his change in mental status were discontinued ; those included Temocillin , Nortriptyline , Haldol , Lorazepam , Venlafaxine , Bupropion , and Gabapentin .\\nIn addition , his cyclosporin levels were checked .\\n3. Hypo or hyperglycemia :\\nMahoney had been following with their appreciated recommendations on glucose control .\\nFinger sticks were in the 150 s when acutely agitated , therefore , it was not determined that glucose levels were contributory .\\n4. Infectious causes were evaluated .\\nHe was febrile in the Intensive Care Unit to 101.0 F. ; yet , chest x-ray , blood cultures , urinalysis and urine cultures were all negative for sources .\\nA lumbar puncture was considered , although not performed due to the fact that the cerebrospinal fluid was not breached during the procedure .\\n5. Mass effect was considered , although no focal deficits were ever noted on examination and due to the fluctuating sensorium , it was determined that there was no severe underlying structural abnormality .\\nA head and neck CT scan , non-contrast , were ordered though to evaluate for such processes .\\nNo acute intracranial hemorrhages or midline shifts were noted , although a soft tissue mass was noted at the level of C2 .\\nThis was determined to be within the normal expected changes post surgery .\\n6. Trauma was also considered .\\nThe patient was found out of bed but no signs of head trauma , no loss of consciousness .\\nThroughout his stay , Chem-10 was monitored .\\nThere were no electrolytes or mineral abnormalities that could explain his delirium .\\nLiver function tests were checked , only total bilirubin was slightly elevated at 1.6 .\\nTSH was within normal limits as was B12 and folate .\\nRPR evaluating for possible neurologic syphilis was also checked .\\nThe assay was nonreactive .\\nAn EEG was also considered to rule out non-convulsive status epilepticus , although again this did not seem to be a likely cause .\\nOn the evening of the 22nd , the patient became acutely agitated , threatening to leave , and also threatening to harm those nurses and physicians that were attempting to prevent him from leaving .\\nSecurity was notified who then arrived to the room and helped to place the patient in four-point\\nrestraints , for the safety of both the patient and the staff of the hospital .\\nThe restraints were weaned off overnight although he became acutely agitated and they were replaced early on 08-31 .\\nLater in the morning on 08-31 , the patient was more oriented and alert , and asked to have the restraints removed .\\nThey were taken off two at a time .\\nThe patient continued to do well and did not require restraints after that event .\\nIntramuscular as well as intravenous Haldol were ordered p.r.n. for emergency use should he become acutely agitated .\\nhaldol as well as the restraints were not required after the morning of the 23rd .\\nEach progressive day,  Mr. Donald delirium abated with return to baseline mental status early on 09-01 .\\nThe likely cause of the delirium was a combination of surgery and Intensive Care Unit stay in addition to poly-pharmacy .\\nOther concerns during his stay was his kidney function , due to his renal transplant in 2003 .\\nHis immunosuppressive therapy was continued throughout his stay ; his creatinine remained approximately 2.3 to 2.4 ; he has a baseline renal insufficiency .\\nWith this in mind , when obtaining a CT scan it was determined that contrast would not be the best option .\\nWhile the patient was in restraints , gentle hydration was initiated since p.o. intake was not adequate .\\nAs for his diabetes mellitus , the Mahoney Team provided updated recommendations each day , adjusting for the changing p.o. intake .\\nThe only other complaints from Mr. Mackey during his stay were :\\nSoreness at his operative sites , for which he was given p.r.n. Tylenol once his delirium had resolved .\\nIn addition , he also complained of difficulty with swallowing , necessitating only soft and liquid diet .\\nThis was attributed to postoperative swelling and changes from his diskectomy performed 2010-08-27 .\\nDISPOSITION :\\nThe patient was discharged on 09-02 .\\nDISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS :\\n1. Follow-up with Dr. Williams on Tuesday , 09-07 , at noon .\\n2. Follow-up with Dr. Michael , his psychiatrist , on Wednesday , 09-08 .\\n3.

retrograde cholangiopancreatography also demonstrated similar findings\\nand it is noted there was nodularity in the common bile duct which is worrisome for cholangiocarcinoma .\\nTherefore , the patient was taken to the Operating Room on 2009-08-24 for a Whipple procedure versus hepaticojejunostomy .\\nOn exploration of the abdomen revealed significant nodularity of the liver indicating of advanced cirrhosis .\\nIntraoperative frozen section of the distal and proximal common bile duct in the\\nregion nodularity , which is identified previously by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography , and regional lymph nodes were all sent to pathology .\\nThey were all negative for malignancy and therefore a hepaticojejunostomy\\nwas performed .\\nCholangiogram on postoperative day number two showed no evidence of leakage at the anastomosis site .\\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well and he was sent to the floor in stable condition .\\nThe patient 's postoperative course was notable for an elevation in white blood cell count peaking at 30.0 on postoperative day number two .\\nHe was given Unasyn for empiric antibiotic treatment .\\nAt the time , blood , urine and bile was sent for culture , which were all negative .\\nA chest x-ray was also negative for any pneumonia .\\nPostoperatively , Mr. Cordano also suffered from low urine output ranges between 25 to 30 cc per hour .\\nFractional excretion of sodium was less than 1% suggesting a prerenal etiology .\\nThe sodium creatinine peaked at 2.0 and the patient was treated with boluses of intravenous fluid and intravenous albumin infusion was also administered .\\nHe responded well to this regimen and made adequate urine output .\\nAt the same time , the patient also developed distentions of the abdomen consistent with accumulation of ascitic fluid .\\nHe also had significant lower extremity and scrotum edema .\\nOn postoperative day number eight , the patient 's oxygen saturation dropped to 85% on room air and he was transferred to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit for fluid management .\\nChest x-ray and sputum culture obtained at the time were negative and the patient was treated with 100% nonrebreather which improved his oxygenation .\\nWhile he is in the Surgical Intensive Care Unit , paracentesis was performed and it\\nrevealed greater than 24,000 white blood cell count in the ascites which is consistent with SVT .\\nHe was given Zosyn for empiric treatment .\\nGram stain and culture of the ascites failed to identify any organism .\\nHe was weaned from oxygen requirement and was continued on normal saline boluses and\\nintravenous albumin for treatment of prerenal azotemia .\\nSomatostatin and midodrine were also given for this condition and he also received packed red blood cells .\\nOn postoperative day number ten , the patient returned to the floor with improved renal function and without oxygen requirement .\\nThe somatostatin and the midodrine were discontinued and the regimen of Lasix and spironolactone was started for diuresis .\\nHis creatinine levels trended toward normal and the fractional excretion of sodium also increased indicating a resolution of the prerenal kidney failure .\\nOn postoperative day number 17 , the patient was discharged .\\nAt the time he took good po .\\nHe has a PICC line in place for continued treatment with Rocephin and he will have a visiting nurse to help him to administer these medications .\\nWhile in the hospital , the patient received initial work-up including echocardiogram , electrocardiogram and serology studies to be listed for liver transplant .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\n1.

sublingual nitroglycerin .\\nOn 2016-06-26 , he had a positive exercise tolerance test .\\nCardiac catheterization at the end of October revealed a dilated aortic root to 4.4 cm and 80% stenosis of the mid left anterior descending at the bifurcation involving the diagonal branch , 70% stenoses of the left circumflex and oblique marginal artery and 90% stenosis of the posterior descending artery .\\nHis atrioventricular valve gradient was 27 with an AV surface area of .91 .\\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS :\\nReview of systems shows that the patient denies any orthopnea , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea .\\nHe has no bleeding or clotting problems .\\nJuanita does not feel any palpitations .\\nHe does not have wheezing , claudication or gastrointestinal bleeding .\\nNor does he have any history of

.\\nGastroesophageal reflux disease .\\nALLERGIES :\\nNo known drug allergies .\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\\nOne aspirin a day .\\nNexium 40 mg a day .\\nCarvedilol 6.125 mg a day .\\nGlucophage 25 mg once a day .\\nLipitor 10 mg once a day .\\nSOCIAL HISTORY :\\nHe lives with his wife and works as a drug representative for Carvedilol .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nOn physical examination , the patient is afebrile .\\nWeight is 82 kilograms .\\nBlood pressure 126/66 .\\nGeneral :\\nActive , well-developed , well-nourished male .\\nHead and neck examination :\\nNo bruits appreciated .\\nLungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally .\\nHeart was regular rate and rhythm .\\nS1 and S2 .\\n3/6 systolic ejection murmur throughout his precordium .\\nHis abdomen is soft , nontender , nondistended .\\nNo hepatosplenomegaly and no CVA tenderness .\\nExtremities are warm , well perfused , no cyanosis , clubbing or\\nedema .\\nPalpable dorsalis pedis pulses .\\nNo varicosities noted .\\nThe patient was also noted to be right handed .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nHe was admitted to the cardiac surgery service for an elected Bental procedure with homograft and coronary artery bypass graft .\\nOnce consent and preoperative evaluation was complete , he was taken to the operating room .\\nPlease refer to the previously dictated operative note of 2016-12-30 by Dr. Lawrence .\\nBriefly , the patient was taken to the operating room to repair his critical aortic stenosis , his coronary artery disease and his significantly dilated ascending aortic aneurysm .\\nThe procedure was an aortic valve replacement with a tissue valve , a coronary artery bypass graft procedure where five grafts were performed .\\nThe left internal mammary artery was connected to the proximal left anterior descending and saphenous vein grafts were connected to the posterior descending artery , diagonal branch , obtuse marginal and distal left anterior descending .\\nFinally , a super coronary arch graft was implanted .\\nThis was a .................... graft .\\nCardiopulmonary bypass time was 234 minutes .\\nHis aorta was cross clamped for 168 minutes .\\nHe had pharmacologic circulatory arrest for 18 minutes .\\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the unit , intubated on Milrinone , Levophed and Propofol drips .\\nThe rest of the hospital stay can be discussed in terms of system based approach .\\nPulmonary :\\nThe patient remained intubated until postoperative day number five .\\nAfter that , the patient had no major problems with his lungs .\\nHis oxygen saturations remained good and he did not require supplemental oxygen more than a couple of days after his extubation .\\nHe was sent to the floor from the cardiac surgery recovery unit on postoperative day number seven .\\nAfter an extended stay for hemodynamic monitoring and pressor support to maintain his perfusion .\\nNeurologic :\\nThe major neurologic event of this hospital course was that the patient was slow to awake after his Propofol drip was discontinued .\\nBecause of his confusion , a neurology consult was obtained and subsequent radiographic imaging revealed chronic appearing infarcts in the right occipital lobe as well as both cerebellar hemispheres , suggestive of more chronic infarcts , as well as an area in the left corona radiata , adjacent to the left lateral ventricle which may or may not be an acute infarct .\\nThis was seen on the CAT scan on postoperative day number one , 12-31 .\\nAs the patient became more awake , he still remained somewhat confused and a little bit out of it .\\nIn addition , he was noted to have a right sided hemiplegia .\\nOver his postoperative course , Mr. Douglass has gradually been able to utilize more and more of his right side and with the assistance of physical therapy and occupational therapy , he has 4 to 5 + strength in his right hand and arm and about 4 + strength in his right leg .\\nHe is able to walk about the floor on the days prior to discharge , with the assistance of the physical therapist and nurses .\\nIn addition , Mr. Douglass is given Trazodone to help him sleep at night .\\nA psychiatric consult was also obtained due to his mental status and confusion postoperatively but his psychiatric issues are mostly related to his neurologic insults and he has no distinctive psychiatric disorder , except for perhaps postoperative delirium .\\nCardiovascularly , the patient did extremely well following the surgery .\\nThe Levophed drip was continued until postoperative day number one .\\nMilrinone was continued until postoperative day number three , at which point he was having good enough cardiac output that he did not need these drips to help maintain his blood pressure anymore .\\nHe has remained without any chest pain following this procedure and his sternal wound is clean , dry and intact at the end of the procedure .\\nIn addition , he has hypertension , for which he receives Metoprolol and he has hypercholesterolemia , for which he receives nothing at this time .\\nPulmonary :\\nThe patient remained intubated until postoperative day number five .\\nHe was diuresed and was soon saturating very well on room air .\\nGastrointestinal :\\nThe patient has gastroesophageal reflux disease , for which he has been receiving Zantac as an inpatient .\\nWe will put him back on his Nexium .\\nIn addition , over the last couple of days prior to discharge , the patient did appear a little bit icteric .\\nLiver function tests were obtained and they were slightly elevated liver function tests and ALT was 44 , AST was 34 ; alkaline phosphatase was 199 , within normal limits .\\nTotal bilirubin was 2.8 .\\nAmylase was 108 and lipase was 213 .\\nA right upper quadrant ultrasound did not reveal any gallstones or common bile duct dilatation indicative of cholecystitis or cholelithiasis .\\nIn addition , the patient did have slightly elevated blood sugars over the last couple of days and has required an insulin sliding scale and basal insulin to maintain his blood sugars at a more appropriate level .\\nThe ideal blood sugar levels for Mr. Douglass in this postoperative period should be less than 140 .\\nPlease stay on top of the sliding scale so that the patient can keep a euglycemic level .\\nHematologic :\\nThe patient , during this admission , required transfusion of three units of packed red blood cells to maintain adequate hematocrit .\\nAt the time of discharge , Mr. Norman hematocrit is at 40.7 .\\nFluids , electrolytes and nutrition :\\nThe patient did receive a significant amount of diuresis postoperatively and is well below his baseline with weight , most likely because of his inability to eat because of his stroke .\\nOnce he was coherent enough , the patient was evaluated by the swallow team who\\ndeclared him at first an aspiration risk .\\nAs Mr. Douglass has improved from his initial stroke , he has become more lucid\\nand is less of an aspiration risk .\\nOn 01-12 , one day prior to discharge , he was cleared by the swallow team to eat\\na diet as he wishes .\\nHe is going out on a cardiac healthy , diabetic diet , as tolerated with Boost supplements .\\nInfectious disease :\\nThe patient had positive blood and urine cultures on 01-05 for history of Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus , which was pan sensitive .\\nHe was started on Oct. 25 for this bug .\\nOn 01-08 , the patient 's central venous line was discontinued .\\nThe catheterization tip also grew out Serratia .\\nOn the 16th , a urine culture was obtained and did grow out greater than 100,000 colonies of E. coli which was intermittently resistant to Ciprofloxacin .\\nHe was started on Bactrim for that .\\nPlease continue Mr. David Montero for one month to fight his blood borne infection , to prevent seeding of his aortic graft and continue Bactrim for ten days after discharge to treat the E. coli in his urine .\\nDISPOSITION :\\nMr. Douglass is being discharged on 2017-01-13 to a rehabilitation facility in good condition .\\nFOLLOW-UP :\\nOne to two weeks with his primary care physician and two to three weeks with his cardiologist and at one month with Dr. Costello .\\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSES :\\nCoronary artery disease , status post coronary artery bypass graft .\\nCritical aortic stenosis , status post aortic valve replacement .\\nAortic arch aneurysm , status post aortic arch graft .\\nAcute postoperative delirium .\\nPerioperative stroke .\\nChronic blood loss anemia and chronic RBC transfusion

SOB : Most consistent with CHF by exam , although unknown what the severity of her COPD is currently .\\nTTE revealed large pericardial effusion .\\nPt is now s/p drainage of right pleural effusion , diagnostic and therapeutic , with studies consistent with transudate , etiology most likely 02-15 CHF .\\nWe continued her albuterol / atrovent nebs , diuresis with IV lasix drip and boluses .\\nHer 05-27 CXR post procedure w/o PNX , effusion much improved , yet her 05-28 CXR worse than 05-27 with some reaccumulation of right pleural effusion .\\nThen , on 05-29 , she demonstrated bilateral pleural effusions ( reaccumulated ), right lower lobe infiltrate ( started on vanco / zosyn )-> put on face mask , given lasix x 1 bolus 100 mg , responded somewhat and o2 sat stable in low 90 s.\\nShe was given 200 mg IV lasix X 1 with an additional 100 cc of urine output the evening of 5/16 .\\nHer lasix gtt continued during this time .\\nHer oxygen sats did not improve .\\nShe was then made CMO .\\nSee above .\\n#. Pericardial effusion : unclear etiology , OSH had raised question of RV perforation from pacer , however she had a normal echo appearance of lead , no tamponade by exam .\\nThis has still be known to occur during the placement of pacemaker .\\nIt was felt posthumously that her large pericardial effusion was most likely secondary to a complication of pacer placement , although this was not seen on imaging .\\nIn the last 12 hours of her life , her pulsus was 12 , and she was felt to likely to have aspect of tamponade physiology , since her preload was reduced .\\n#. CHF : normal EF on TTE so possibly with diastolic dysfunction , ruled out for MI\\n- See course of diuresis above .\\n- We continued ASA / imdur / CCB / hold diovan until pt was made CMO .\\n#. Pleural effusions : Likely due to CHF although had some leukocytosis at admission to OSH .\\nMary studies c/w transudate .\\n- After she was made CMO , the pt was started on Morphine gtt to maximize comfort and minimize air hunger .\\n#.

Oliguric ARF : likely prerenal due to n/v poor po intake and poor forward flow , However , need to continue diuresis .\\nHer urine lytes consistent with ATN , FENA 4% .\\nRenal u/s negative for hydronephrosis .\\nRenal consultants did not feel that there was an indication for urgent hemodialysis .\\nShe continued to put out low amounts of urine throughout the admission , despite aggressive diuresis with IV lasix gtt and boluses .\\nSee above .\\n#. ID : initially had leukocytosis at admission , with chest CT showing possible underlying consolidations vs. atelectasis , levoflox started 05-24 and subsequently stopped ( no consolidations on CXR and afebrile ).\\nU/A on 05-27 c/w UTI .\\nPt now on IV Ceftriaxone ( was on levoflox since 05-24 however UA now floridly positive ( more so than UA at OSH ) so felt possibly levo-resistant .\\nPt started on CTX 05-27 .\\nShe was empirically started on vanco/zosyn for empiric hosp acquired pna coverage\\n- possible opacity on CXR - along w/ leukocytosis .\\n#.

Hypotension : The patient 'd pm BP meds were held 11-14 and she was administered 1.5L NS over the course of the day with subsequent SBP s in the high 90 s, low 100 s,.\\nThe hypotension was likely due to volume depletion caused by her diarrhea / loose stools in addition to decreased PO intake secondary to her GERD and thrush .\\nAll of this occurred in the setting of aggressive BP management with metoprolol 25 BID , HCTZ / Triampterene ( as a replacment for lasix due to recurrent hypokalemia ), Benicar 20 mg QD , and Imdur 30 mg QD .\\nInfection / sepsis was not likely given she was afebrile and had no localizing sx with an improving lung exam and 02 requirement .\\nGiven the patient 's recent RP bleed , there was concern for a recurrent bleed .\\nHer groin exam was unchanged .\\nHer Hct dropped from Hct 38.9 before fluids to 35.5 s/p 1.5L NS and was thought to be dilutional .\\nRepeat hcts were stable .\\nThe patient was kept an additional two days to follow her hcts and titrate her BP meds .\\nAs volume depletion was thought to be the cause of her low BP , only the BBlocker was restarted .\\nShe was also placed on on low dose spironolactone as a K sparing diuretic and for BP control in addition to Toprol XL 25 mg QD for her coronary disease .\\nShe tolerated these meds with SBP s in the high 90 s to 100 s and was therefore discharged on this regimen .\\nShe will need follow up with her PCP within B week after discharge from the extended care facility for further BP titration and monitoring of her electrolytes .\\n2. Thrush : This is likely secondary to her steroid inhalers and PO prednisone for COPD exacerbation .\\nShe was started on nystatin swish and swallow QID .\\nThe patient was encouraged to take PO liquids to prevent volume depletion .\\n3. diarrhea : The patient has been having loose stools at night and was guiac pos x 2 .\\nStool for C.diff toxin was sent x 1 and was negative .\\nHer bowel regimen is prn .\\nGastroenteritis is possible but she has no vomiting and only occ nausea with meds .\\nThere is no evidence of obstruction on AXR .\\nTherefore , the cause of her mild diarrhea ( few loose BM / liquid stool / night ) may be either viral or secondary to resolving abdominal hematoma with resultant irritation of GI system .\\nWe have advised a BRAT diet .\\n4. guiac pos stool : Given the patient 's sx of GERD , current PO steroid regimen , and ASA for her stents , the ddx for her guiac positive stools would include gastritis / gastric ulcer in addition to lower GI pathology .\\nHowever , she has no vomiting and only mild nausea with medications .\\nShe also has no gross blood per rectum and her hct is stable .\\nUpon discharge the patient was changed to a BID protonix regimen .\\nDr. Valerio office was notified about the patient 's discharge plans and status .\\nShe will need outpatient follow up for her guiac pos stools with endoscopy vs EGD +/- H.pylori serologies .\\nA copy of this dc summary will be faxed to her PCP to ensure proper follow up .\\nDischarge Medications :\\n1.

Chest pain / Fever / Chills :\\nThe acute onset of chest pain was initially very concerning for a PE , however the Chest CT demonstrated multifocal consolidation consistent with a bacterial PNA .\\nThis is consistent with the remainder of the pt \\'s history including fever , chills , sob and an elevated WBC count .\\nThe pt was given ceftriaxone / azithromycin / vancomycin in Deanna .\\nBlood , urine and sputum culutres were sent .\\nPt \\'s blood cultures came back positive for Staph Aureus and Enterococcus , both were pansensitive .\\nSputum culture also returned with Staph. Aureus .\\nCeftriaxone and azithro were discontinued , and Vacomycin was continued .\\nPt initially was hypoxic requiring NRB for O2 sat of 94% , with any attempt to wean she would desat .\\nPt was intubated prior to tunneled catheter removal , see below .\\n( The tunneled catheter later came back for negative for culture. )\\nEarlier that day pt had a chest x ray which showed diffuse infiltrative process concerning for ARDS .\\nPost procedure pt remained intubated on ARDSnet protocol .\\nShe self extubated the first day and was reintubated without any complications .\\nHer O2 requirement improved on the vent over the next few days and she was weaned off the vent on 2013-01-01 .\\nAfter extubation her o2 requirement was down to 1L NC with sats in mid 90s .\\nShe was transferred to the floor for further managment .\\nThe patient remained afebrile when she transferred to the medicine service .\\nShe was weaned off the oxygen and for the remainder of her course her O2sats were stable on room air .\\nThe patient had completed her antibiotic course while in house .\\n2. Hx of multiple port-o-cath clots :\\nAlthough the pt is on warfarin chronically , her INR was subtherapeutic .\\nGoal INR 01-31 .\\nInitially coumadin was increased , however given concern for infected line , general surgery was consulted who removed the line in the ICU .\\n3. ARF :\\nPt initially with mild ARI , this was thought to be due to dehydration , after initial volume repletion her renal function improved to her baseline .\\n4. CMED :\\nThe pt has a history of paranoia / depression .\\nON admission she was taking Quetiapine 300 mg QHS and Clonazepam 1 mg QAM , 1 mg Q3PM , 2 mg PO QHS .\\nQuetiapine was continued however clonipin was initially held when she was intubated on fentynyl / versed .\\nThis was restarted post extubation .\\nIntially after being transferred from the ICU to the medicine service the patient was mentating appropriately .\\nHer course later became complicated by visual and auditory hallucinations .\\nShe made disturbing comments to the hospital personnel .\\nShe was unable to sleep at night , often pacing the halls .\\nShe required a 1:1 sitter .\\nPsychiatry was consulted .\\nThey felt that her presentation was secondary to delirium and was multifactorial .\\nThey attributed it to polypharmacy , recent infection ( pneumonia ) and insomnia .\\nA head CT was done which ruled out any acute processes .\\nThe patient refused an LP .\\nThey made recommendations for adjustments to her anti-psychotic medications .\\nAt discharge the patient was on clonazepam 1 mg tid , seroquel 300 BID and neurontin 600 QAM , 1200 QPM and 1200 QHS .\\nThe Kindred Hospital hospital course was prolonged because of her delirium .\\nOnce her mental status improved she was discharged .\\n5. ? Parkinson \\'s Disease / Akithesia :\\nThe patient was maintained Sinemet .\\n6. Pain :\\nIn addition to her usual neuropathy pain , the pt initially appeared to have significant pain from the multi-focal PNA as well .\\n( Home regimen , Gabapentin 800 mg PO QAM , 1600 mg PO Q3PM , 1600 mg PO QHS .\\nThis was held in the ICU and she was given diluadid prn for pain control .\\nThe patient \\'s narcotic and CMED CCU regimen was evaluated by psychiatry during her delirium .\\nPlease see above for their recommendations .\\n7. FEN :\\nGiven her hx of ileostomy secondary to crohn \\'s disease and resultant short gut syndrome , the pt requires nutritional support via TPN .\\nAfter removal of tunneled line pt was given tube feeds while she was intubated .\\nThe patient was transitioned to a low fat , low residue diet .\\n8 .\\nPPX : PPI and heparin SC\\n9.

it was unclear whether he had previously been cardioverted .\\nAnti-coagulation was started with Warfarin 5 mg with a goal of 2-3 and a plan for cardioversion in 6 weeks .\\nThe patient \\'s INR became supratherapeutic and Coumadin was held .\\nHis coumadin was transitioned to 2 mg and then 1 mg .\\nHis INR continued to flucuate .\\nHe was discharged on 1 mg , but a stable regimen had not been achieved .\\nHis INR will have to be monitored closely unitl his levels are stable .\\nHis INR goal is 02-24 .\\n2# SOB on admission :\\nLikely due to CHF exacerbation , with diuresis of over 36 L during his admission .\\nHe had 4 surgeries ( 3 cardiac surgeries ) earlier in the summer , so it is likely that he required copious IVF hydration surrounding these procedures which may have been the cause of his massive fluid overload .\\nIt appears that his diet was regulated at rehab but there is concern for medication non-compliance at rehab , per previous discharge summaries .\\nOn discharge , the patient was maintained on standing diuretics as well as PRN nebs and INH COPD meds .\\n3# Metabolic Alkalosis / Hypochloremia :\\nEtiology most likely a combination of contraction alkalosis and / or post-hypercapnia .\\nThis acutely worsened on 2017-09-18 , when the patient was found to have mental status changes and an ABG revealed a CO2 of over 100 , likley due to a depressed respiratory drive secondary to sedatives given for agitation on top of a preexisting alkalosis .\\nThe patient was therefore intubated for ventilation , and continued to be diuresed .\\nHis CO2 improved and he was extubated after a few days .\\nAll sedating medications were held and serial ABGs were trended to follow the resolution of the metabolic alkalosis .\\n4# Pleural effusions : s/p right thoracentesis on 2017-09-06 , 1600 mL of serosanguinous fluid removed from right pleural space .\\nGram stain and cultures were negative , cytology was negative .\\nThe right pleural effusion slowly re-accumulated after tap but resolved after continued diuresis .\\nRepeat CXR showed improvement of the effusion and on discharge he had been breathing well on room air without complications\\n5# T2DM :\\nThe patient was started on Glargine for tighter glycemic control and was covered with an insulin sliding scale .\\nHe was monitored with QID fingersticks .\\nHis blood sugars were in the 100s on discharge .\\n6# Hyperlipidemia :\\nThe patient was continued on his statin .\\n7# COPD :\\nThe patient was continued on nebs\\n8# MS changes :\\nThe patient has a history of baseline dementia which was confounded by delerium in the face of metabolic abnormalities .\\nHis mental status improved as his metabolic process was resolved as detailed above .\\nNeurology was also consulted and a head CT showed old lacunar infarcts but no acute causes for a change in mental status .\\nAn EEG showed mild encephalopathy , but no other findings .\\nHis mental status did clear somewhat with the addition of standing lactulose ; he was discharged on this medication .\\n9# Hypothyroidism :\\nThe patient was continued on his outpatient dose of Levothyroxine .\\n10# ? UTI :\\nThe patient was started on levofloxacin at Newton-Wellesley Hospital for a question of UTI based on U/A positive for WBC .\\nUCx during this hospitalization were negative and Levofloxacin was d/c \\'d .\\n11# Chronic lower back pain :\\nThe patient was treated with a Lidocaine patch and Percocet prn .\\nStronger narcotics were avoided given somnolence and MS changes .\\n12# Wound Care :\\nThe patient has left chest wound and left gluteal pressure ulcer .\\nWound care was consulted on 2017-09-05 and they made several recommendations .\\nFor the left gluteal pressure ulcer , they recommended gentle cleansing with normal saline or commercial wound cleaner , thin layer of Duoderm gel , air dry , allevyn foam adhesive over the site , and change every 2 days or prn .\\nFor the left chest wound , they recommended cleansing with commercial wound cleanser , pat dry , pack aquacel AG rope and moisten with saline , cover with dry gauze and change daily .\\nThese recommendations were followed throughout the admission .\\n13# Voiding :\\nPt. failed multiple attempts to void on his own .\\nCase was discussed with neurology .\\nHe was started on finsateride on the day prior to admission .\\nHe is scheduled to follow up with urology to address this issue .\\nUntil then , his foley should remain in place .\\n14# Code :\\nThe patient was full code during admission .\\nMedications on Admission :\\nLevothyroxine 100 mcg PO daily\\nDuloxetine 20 mg PO QHS\\nOndansetron PRN\\nPercocet 1 tab PRN\\nSenna PRN\\nColace PRN\\nLasix 80 mg PO BID\\nLactulose PRN\\nLidocaine patch\\nNystatin powder\\nGabapentin 300 mg PO TID\\nAlb nebs\\nFluticasone / Salmeterol\\nTiotropium Bromide\\nSpironolactone 25 mg PO daily\\nEpoetin 4000 units MWF\\nRISS\\nAmiodarone 200 mg PO daily\\nCalcium Acetate 667 mg PO TID\\nSubQ Heparin\\nPantoprazole 40 mg PO daily\\nSimvastatin 40 mg PO QHS\\nASA 81 mg PO daily\\nMVI\\nTylenol PRN\\nDischarge Medications :\\n1.

this was thought to be secondary to a more pervasive process , likely anoxic encephalopathy , for which the prognosis is extremely grim .\\nThis was discussed at length in several family meetings involving the patient 's wife , son , primary care doctor , ICU attending , and neurology consultant in the presence of a Asian interpreter .\\nThe end result of these discussion was that the patient 's wishes would not be consistent with this new level of functioning from which he had little hope of recovery ; the family decided to make him comfort measures only .\\nHe was disconnected from the ventilator and all medications beyond a morphine drip were stopped , and he expired shortly thereafter .\\nThe family was present .\\nMedications on Admission :\\nJevity 1.2 65 mL / hour continuous with water 240 cc q 8 hours\\nLasix 40 mg IV QAM ( given 08-14 )\\nVancomycin 1 gm IV q 36 hours ( last dose at 2000 on 08-13 ) .\\nStarted on 08-09 )\\nASA 325 mg PO QD\\nLansoprazole 30 mg PO QAM\\nHeparin 5000 units SC TID\\nZosyn 4.5 gm IV q 8 hours ( last dose on 08-14 at 1400 ) , started 08-08 .\\nMetoprolol 37.5 mg q 12 hours ( last dose 07/25 in AM )\\nProtein / Soy supplement 2 scoops q 12 hours\\nIpratropium / Albuterol inhaler 4 puffs QID\\nCompleted course of Flagyl 07-25 --> 08-10 .\\nDischarge Disposition :\\nExpired\\nDischarge Diagnosis :\\nAnoxic encephalopathy\\nAcute respiratory failure\\nChronic respiratory failure\\nPseudomonal pneumonia\\nVolume overload\\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease\\nBronchiectasis\\nHyponatremia\\nAnemia of chronic disease\\nSecondary :\\n1.

Hypotension - The patient was initially mildly hypotensive with systolic blood pressures in the 80s .\\nUpon admission it was unclear whether or not the patient was volume overloaded or volume depleted .\\nInitially he was treated with intravenous fluids with a dramatic response in his systolic blood pressure .\\nHowever , subsequent it was determined that the patient 's hypotension may have been related to his rapid ventricular response and right heart failure .\\nTherefore the focus of treatment was changed to controlling his rate .\\n2. Atrial fibrillation - The patient 's Digoxin had been weaned off prior to his admission .\\nIt was felt that this potentially had lead to his atrial flutter and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response .\\nThe patient was loaded once again with Digoxin and his beta blocker was increased to 100 mg of Lopressor , three times a day .\\nIn addition the patient was started on Verapamil since his heart rate had remained mildly tachycardiac in the low 100s .\\n3. Congestive heart failure - During the initial course of the patient 's admission , it was unclear as to whether or not he was volume overloaded or volume depleted .\\nThe patient was initially treated with intravenous fluids , however , subsequently he was diuresed when he became symptomatic and short of breath .\\nChest x-rays revealed evidence of congestive heart failure .\\nThe decision was made to have the patient undergo a cardiac catheterization to fully evaluate the hemodynamics to determine the etiology of the patient 's heart failure .\\nIn addition , plans were made to evaluate the patient 's cardiac arteries to determine if he had any component of ischemic cardiomyopathy .\\n4. Abnormal liver function tests - The patient had an isolated , elevated alkaline phosphatase with a confirmatory elevation in his gamma glutamyl transferase .\\nAn ultrasound of the right upper quadrant did not reveal any cholelithiasis or cholecystitis , however , an irregular hepatic contour was seen which is suggestive of underlying chronic liver disease .\\nThere was some concern that the patient may have a partial biliary obstruction and the patient was sent for an magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography to further evaluate the biliary system .\\nMagnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography did not reveal any evidence of biliary dilatation or of any obstructing pancreatic mass .\\nAgain seen was a slightly irregular contour of the liver with dilated hepatic veins suggesting chronic hepatic vascular congestion .\\nThe patient also revealed a prior history of heavy alcohol use for approximately 20 years , during the mid 1950s to mid 1970s .\\nIt was felt that he may have had some component of vascular congestion from his congestive heart failure as well as possibly some mild cirrhotic changes secondary to his previous alcohol use .\\n5. Fall - The patient had a mechanical fall during his admission .\\nHe did not sleep at all the night before and was extremely fatigued .\\nHe was walking in the hall , dragging his intravenous pole when he tripped over the foot of the pole and lost his balance .\\nHe fell backwards , landing on his buttocks and bumped his head .\\nHis neurological examination at that time was nonfocal and the head was atraumatic without any evidence of a hematoma .\\nA computerized axial tomography scan of his head at that time did not reveal any extra or intracranial hemorrhage .\\n6. Rectal bleeding - The patient has a history of rectal bleeding , ever since his brachytherapy for his prostate cancer .\\nThe patient has been treated with Argon laser therapy in the past for his rectal bleeding and it is recommended that he follow up with his gastroenterologist for repeat Argon laser therapy .\\nThe remainder of the hospital course will be dictated by the covering intern .\\nSheila Providence , M.D. 50-442\\nDictated By : Marjorie I.

the right wrist and hand .\\n4-to 4+ strength at the left ankle , 4+ strength at the right knee and right ankle .\\nShe is unable to lift either foot off the bed .\\nThe extra ocular movements are full .\\nTongue protrudes 4 cm .\\nShe is drowsy at times , but generally alert , responsive , interactive , able to talk in two to three word sentences when she wants to .\\nShe has severe memory deficits , but nevertheless , is able to engage in conversation , answers questions , names things well , does calculations and recognizes family members and states preferences .\\nShe has been working with Speech Therapy , occupational therapy and physical therapy closely and should continue to show improvement .\\nShe is anticoagulated on Coumadin and this has been stable .\\nShe is do not resuscitate in agreement with the wishes of her multiple family members .\\nFollow up computerized tomography scans and magnetic resonance imaging studies have shown infarction in bilateral basis pontis , mid brain , the superior cerebellar areas , left thalamus , bilateral temporal lobes medially and inferiorly and left posterior communicating artery .\\nThe patient had fevers sporadically during this hospitalization with rising white blood counts .\\nA chest X-ray documented a progressing left lower lobe infiltrate .\\nInitially this improved on Clindamycin and Cefotetan , but fevers recurred on this antibiotic regimen .\\nSputum grew out Klebsiella pneumoniae , and she was treated with Gentamicin and Ancef for 14 days intravenous ( bug being sensitive to these two drugs ) .\\nA left pleural effusion developed and this was tapped with ultrasound guidance , and found to be sterile , and without evidence of empyema .\\nThe patient is on Ciprofloxacin .\\nThe day of discharge is day #3 of 7 , after which antibiotics should be totally discontinued .\\nShe has developed bad thrush in this setting , she is not yet able to swallow and so she is on Nystatin swish and spit five times a day .\\nShe also gets Peridex to clean out her mouth .\\nOnce her liver enzymes are completely normal , a seven day course of Fluconazol may be helpful if the thrush is not spontaneously resolving off of antibiotics .\\nShe has been afebrile for greater than 10 days , including several days on oral antibiotics .\\nThe patient &apos;s liver enzymes were noted to be elevated mid way through her hospital course , to about three times normal , especially the SGOT and SGPT .\\nThese have spontaneously reversed , and are nearly normal at the time of discharge .\\nA right upper quadrant ultrasound documented gallstones , without evidence of common bile duct dilatation or active cholecystitis .\\nThe exact cause of her liver enzyme elevation is unclear , but we are being careful about administering drugs , which might irritate the liver .\\nThe patient had a steady decline in her hematocrit during this hospitalization .\\nIron studies are all entirely normal , her anemia is attributed to anemia or chronic disease with hypoproliferation as well as multiple phlebotomies .\\nThe plan is to give her folic acid , but not iron .\\nThe patient &apos;s potassiums have been repeatedly low and require daily checks and repletion .\\nThis is thought due to the extensive course of Gentamicin which she received .\\nThis must be carefully checked despite the standing order for potassium .\\nThe patient has had low sodiums during this hospitalization .\\nThis may due to her central nervous system process or her pulmonary process , with fluids administered as described , she should not have any problems from this .\\nHer sodiums were never below 130 .\\nShe does well with tube feeds .\\nHer tube feeds orders are as follow :\\nfull strength Replete with fiber at 70 cc. per hour .\\nIn addition , the patient gets 250 cc. of juice ( not water ) three times a day .\\nShe also gets Lactinex granules three packages in each bottle of tube feeds .\\nShe also gets Metamucil one teaspoon with the first bolus of juice each day .\\nPlease note that evaluation by the swallowing therapist , showed that the patient is aspirating at this time , but there is great hope from the nature of her deficit and the good movements of her tongue that normal swallowing should return soon .\\nIt is for this reason that she is discharged with an nasogastric tube and that no plans for G tube placement are made at this time .\\nShe has a history of of angina without myocardial infarction that has not been worked up .\\nShe did have brief chest pain twice during this admission that did not correlate with electrocardiogram changes .\\nIn the first week of November , her electrocardiogram showed T wave inversions in the lateral leads , correlating with an increase in the LDH , but not CK .\\nThis did not normalize with administration of Isordil and the patient denied chest pain at this time .\\nAs of 4/7 , her electrocardiogram had reverted back to normal and there is no evidence of congestive heart failure or continued electrocardiogram changes , and chest pain is absent .\\nHer cholesterol was 350 here .\\nShe has been off of her hypercholesterol medicines .\\nThese can be restarted when it is deemed reasonable , in view of her acute disease and recently elevated liver enzymes .\\nNote that the liver enzymes were normal on admission , at which time she was taking all of the above cholesterol medicines .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nMetamucil 1 teaspoon q.d. , with first bolus of juice , juice 250 cc. down nasogastric

had to catch her from falling down &quot; as she toppled towards the right .\\nShe evidently recovered from the episode after a number of minutes .\\nThe following day , she remained in bed through essentially all of the day due to malaise with no specific deficits being noted .\\nIn the subsequent two days , she had several small spells of &quot; imbalance &quot; , particularly towards the right , and other symptoms included diffuse and mainly frontal headaches and mild neck soreness .\\nThere was no diplopia , visual loss , speech abnormality or sensory change in her history .\\nShe was initially evaluated at an outside hospital emergency room , and then transferred to Well General Hospital .\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\nIs notable for depression , and she has been followed regularly by Dr. Freiermchird of Nash Health for several months with pharmacologic treatment , which is apparently working well .\\nHer Doxepin has recently been increased .\\nShe is status post appendectomy and otherwise has no remarkable past medical history .\\nALLERGIES :\\nQuinine gives her a rash .\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\\nThe only medications she is on are Paxil 30 mg p.o. q.day , Doxepin 25 mg p.o. q.day , and Klonopin 2 mg p.o. q.h.s.\\nSOCIAL HISTORY :\\nShe is currently unemployed , but until recently , she was employed at a bank .\\nShe was born and raised in Atonlaremont Rockpo .\\nThere is a history of childhood abuse .\\nShe does not drink .\\nShe is a former tobacco user and takes no illicit drugs .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nShe was pleasant , in no acute distress ;

there were some older hematomas in the bilaterally shins .\\nMental status - her speech was fluent without errors .\\nHer affect was slightly inappropriate at times ; for example , singing or humming along while performing some of the motor tasks and giving the impression of indifference to the deficits that were demonstrated on the examination .\\nHer memory was fully intact for short-term recollection of three out of three objects at five minutes with excellent naming , repetition , proverb interpretation , and ability to follow commands .\\nVisual fields were full to confrontation .\\nHer left pupil was 7 mm reacting to 5 mm .\\nHer right pupil was 5.5 mm reacting to 4 mm .\\nHer extraocular movements were intact for horizontal and vertical pursuits .\\nThere was no nystagmus and no ptosis .\\nHer saccades were normal .\\nFacial strength and sensation were full and symmetric .\\nHer tongue , uvula and palate were midline .\\nShoulder shrug was 5/5 power .\\nMotor examination revealed 5/5 power in all groups in the proximal and distal upper and lower extremities .\\nThere was no drift .\\nThere was normal bulk and tone .\\nShe had slightly slow fine finger motility approximately equal bilaterally , although this was extremely difficult to reproduce .\\nSensory - intact light touch , temperature , and vibration overall .\\nReflexes were 2+ throughout in the upper and lower extremities , and toes were downgoing .\\nThere was no jaw jerk and no Hoffman &apos;s sign .\\nCoordination - toe tap was slow bilaterally , although difficult to reproduce , and at best , was essentially within normal limits .\\nOn standing , she tended to fall to the front , back or sides without trying to stop her fall initially , and extensive gait testing was deferred due to concerns for safety .\\nHer heel-to-shin and finger-to-nose testing was fully intact bilaterally without ataxia or tremor .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nWere unremarkable with normal electrolytes and complete blood count parameters .\\nHer erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 12 .\\nHer coagulation parameters were normal .\\nHead CT scan without contrast showed normal brain parenchyma and no intracranial process .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :\\nThe patient was admitted for her gait disorder with other notable findings on examination including anisocoria , which , by the patient &apos;s report , had been noted several months earlier .\\nA magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance angiogram study was obtained , which showed no clear evidence of arterial dissections or infarction or other pathologic processes .\\nShe had been placed on heparin initially , but this was discontinued after the magnetic resonance imaging results were obtained .\\nPosterior transcranial Doppler studies showed normal studies of both vertebral arteries , and carotid non-invasive studies showed normal right and left carotid bifurcations .\\nOn the second hospital day , her gait continued to be markedly unstable , although with no consistent pattern in terms of weakness or directionality of falling , and she continued to have no reproducible upper extremity or lower extremity ataxia or dysmetria .\\nShe was seen by the Psychiatry Service .\\nShe was not felt to be acutely suicidal or otherwise in need of acute psychiatric treatment .\\nThe psychiatrist also noted the indifference the patient evinced regarding her own symptomatology .\\nThe patient was evaluated in one of the neurology conferences for several hours , and during this time , showed significant improvement while receiving gait training as well as evaluation ; in particular , she became more stable with counter-balancing methods .\\nThis trend of improvement continued , and she was discharged in stable condition .\\nShe will follow up with her psychiatrist , Dr. Freiermchird ( Sone Memorial Hospital ) on a regular basis , and she can follow up with the Neurology Service on a p.r.n. basis if needed .\\nShe will continue on her previous outpatient medical regimen .\\nNIREGE MEMORY , M.D.\\nTR :\\nbzo\\nDD :\\n03/29/97\\nTD :\\n03/31/97 12:36 P\\ncc :\\nNYRI A MEMORY , M.D.\\nASHELLRIETTE NESSASU THREATSVOT , M.D.\\nEJEAN NADARC FREIERMCHIRD , M.D.\\n',\n",

:\\n02/18/1991\\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSES :\\n1) ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY SYNDROME .\\n2) PNEUMOCYSTIS CARINII PNEUMONIA .\\n3) ADULT RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nMr. Breutzfarstxei is a 30 year old man with recently diagnosed acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia who presented with pneumonia , developed adult respiratory distress syndrome , and died in the hospital after failed efforts of ventilatory support .\\nMr. Breutzfarstxei was recently diagnosed with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome when he had Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia on 01/17/91 .\\nHe was admitted to the Retelk County Medical Center at that time and was treated with Bactrim and steroids .\\nHe was actually intubated and underwent bronchoscopy where the diagnosis was made with a positive toluidine blue study .\\nHe initially did well after extubation and completed approximately two weeks of Bactrim and a steroid taper .\\nAt discharge after about two weeks post-extubation , he had an O2 saturation of approximately 95% on room air .\\nHe was seen by Dr. Seen and Dr. Seen as an out-patient .\\nOn 02/06/91 , he was seen in FLFDMC and at that point , his temperature was noted to be 101.4 and he had malaise and diarrhea .\\nHe was evaluated in the Emergency Room .\\nAt that time , his oxygen saturation was only 90% on room air and his chest X-Ray showed no change .\\nCultures were taken and he was sent out .\\nOn 02/08/91 , the patient called Dr. Seen because of increased shortness of breath and malaise .\\nHe was seen in FLFDMC where he was noted to have jaundice and newly palpable liver edge .\\nReview of liver function tests revealed a cholestatic picture which was not previously found and it was felt that this was secondary to the Bactrim which had been recently stopped anyway .\\nHis oxygen saturation at that time was only 86% on room air and he was admitted .\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\n1) HIV positive with a CD4 count of 74 .\\n2) Recent PCP .\\n3) Status post right elbow surgery .\\n4) Venereal disease history .\\n5) PPD anergic .\\nThe patient &apos;s HIV risk factors include history of intravenous drug abuse , prostitution , and a former prisoner .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nOn presentation , the patient was a young appearing Hispanic male in mild respiratory distress with a blood pressure of 140/90 , heart rate 120 , respirations 32 , and temperature 101 .\\nSKIN :\\nJaundiced .\\nHEENT :\\nRevealed icteric sclerae , the oropharynx with extensive thrush , and an ulcer under his tongue .\\nNECK :\\nHe had no cervical adenopathy and his neck was supple .\\nLUNGS :\\nHad tubular breath sounds especially in the lower lung fields .\\nCARDIAC :\\nShowed regular rate and rhythm without murmurs , rubs , or gallops .\\nThere was no costovertebral angle tenderness .\\nABDOMEN :\\nSoft with bowel sounds and there was mid epigastric and right upper quadrant tenderness .\\nHis liver was 10 cm and was felt three finger breadths below the costal margin .\\nHis spleen was not palpable .\\nRECTAL :\\nHe had guaiac positive stools .\\nEXTREMITIES :\\nUnremarkable .\\nGENITOURINARY :\\nHis penis had a 1/2 cm ulcer with yellowish discharge .\\nNEUROLOGICAL :\\nNon-focal .\\nLABORATORY EXAMINATION :\\nOn admission , white count was 7.2 with 57% neutrophils , 40% lymphocytes , l mononuclear cell , and 1.6 eosinophils .\\nPT was 12.6 and PTT was 29 .\\nSodium was 133 , potassium was 4.2 , chloride 100 , CO2 19 , BUN 21 , creatinine 1.2 , and glucose 122 .\\nALT was 181 , AST was 156 , LDH was 336 , alkaline phosphatase was 214 , and bilirubin was 12.7 total .\\n( On 02/06 , his bilirubin had been 7.2 with 6 direct ) .\\nHis arterial blood gas on 50% was pO2 92 , pCO2 24 , and pH 7.46 .\\nHis chest X-Ray showed bilateral nodular infiltrates .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nThe patient was admitted for work-up of his cholestatic jaundice picture along with work-up for his pulmonary process and treatment of both .\\nIn terms of pulmonary function , it was felt that one possibility was that the patient was a Bactrim failure for PCP although this was unusual .\\nHe was started on Pentamidine , especially in light of the fact that it was felt that his liver function tests were due possibly to Bactrim .\\nThe patient was also covered with Erythromycin and Gentamicin for coverage of community acquired pneumonias and gram negative rods .\\nHe was given supplemental oxygen .\\nIn terms of his liver abnormalities , it was felt that viral hepatitis was in the differential as well as several opportunistic infections of the liver but also was felt that Bactrim could be a cause of these abnormalities .\\nTiters for CMV and Epstein-Barr virus were sent and a titer for toxoplasma was sent .\\nStool was sent for ova and parasites .\\nGastrointestinal was consulted .\\nInitially , the patient did well in terms of his pre-status and required less oxygen .\\nHowever , on 02/10/91 , his respiratory rate increased and his oxygen saturation decreased .\\nActually in reviewing the records at this point , it appears that Pentamidine was not started initially so on the antibiotics of Erythromycin and Gentamicin , the patient &apos;s respiratory status worsened and his LDH climbed so he began Pentamidine on 02/10/91 .\\nOn 02/11/91 , the patient again appeared more comfortable this time with 50% facemask but then required more oxygen , dropped his O2 saturations , and was intubated on 02/11/91 .\\nHe was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit on 12/12/90 on Gentamicin , Vancomycin , Pentamidine , and Prednisone .\\nAlso of note at that point , hepatitis C virus serologies had come back positive .\\nHowever , at this point , his liver function test abnormalities appeared more consistent with a cholestatic picture with his direct bilirubin being 12.1 and total being 14.1 .\\nThe patient &apos;s abdominal CT scan showed no liver disease and no obstruction .\\nThe patient &apos;s liver function tests appeared to improve .\\nThe patient &apos;s penile ulcer was cultured and grew positive herpes simplex virus and the patient was started on Acyclovir .\\nOn 02/13/91 , the patient had a bronchoalveolar lavage performed which showed a toluidine blue with many pneumocysts noted .\\nNo other cultures grew out and the patient &apos;s clinical status deteriorated .\\nThe patient required 100% oxygen to maintain adequate oxygen saturations on the ventilator .\\nHe required elevated ventilatory pressures with PIPS often above 60 .\\nFortunately , no evidence of baratroma was ever discerned .\\nHowever , the patient &apos;s respiratory status continued to decline and we were unable to maintain oxygen saturations above 80% even using reverse I to E ventilation , paralysis , sedation , and other modes of ventilation .\\nPatient underwent liver biopsy on 02/16/91 and the results of this were pending when the patient died .\\nThe patient actually developed decreasing counts with white count as low as 1.75 , hematocrit as low as 26 , and platelets as low as 68 noted on 02/15/91 .\\nThese were supported with blood products and Hematology was consulted .\\nThey felt that it was most likely secondary to Bactrim and these actually were getting better when the patient died .\\nBone marrow biopsy was not attempted .\\nDiscussions were begun with the family regarding limits of supportive care .\\nDue to continued worsening pulmonary status and an overall grim prognosis , the family decided , in consultation with the Medical Team , to withdraw ventilatory support .\\nThis was done on the evening of 02/18/91 .\\nPatient expired after the endotracheal tube was withdrawn at 6:40 p.m.\\nDISPOSITION :\\nThe patient died in hospital .\\nAn autopsy will be performed .\\nAn autopsy was performed as per the family &apos;s wishes .\\nWE221/9850 TAKO C.

Pulmonary .\\nFrom a pulmonary standpoint , he continued to complain of shortness of breath .\\nHis apical pneumothorax from the outside hospital had resolved .\\nChest xray was consistent with pleurodesis .\\nHowever , with persistent abdomen distention , there is likely restrictive deficit and , in addition , after each tap , he at times became hypotensive and with some mild fluid resuscitation decompensated with pulmonary edema , requiring both albumin and Lasix to try to mobilize third space fluids .\\nOn the day of discharge , he is stating approximately 91 to 92% on three to four liters .\\nChest xray is still consistent with volume overload .\\nThe plan will be to continue to try to alternate albumin and Lasix to mobilize his fluid .\\n3.

Renal .\\nHe had a creatinine of 4.0 on admission and this decreased down to the mid ones with fluid , currently at 1.7 on discharge .\\nFrom his urinalysis , he has mostly a prerenal state .\\nHowever , he does require diuresis to prevent increased volume overload in his lungs from his hypoalbunemic state .\\nAt the time , Nutrition was following , initially with a low fat , low cholesterol , low sugar diet .\\nHis appetite is decreasing somewhat as his disease process progresses , therefore , we have liberalized his diet for him to take what he wishes .\\n7.

Oncology .\\nThe patient initially came for workup of pancreatic cancer with a questions of palliative chemotherapy .\\nHowever , given his rapid clinical decline , this was deferred and I do not suspect that he will be a candidate for this , as the degree of his decline bodes a poor prognosis for him .\\nHis pain here has been controlled , initially on Oxycontin with morphine for breakthrough pain .\\nAs he becomes progressively more somnolent , this will likely need to be switched to IV pain medications only .\\nDiscussion , at that point in time , should occur with the family about comfort measures and about weaning him from his medications to make him more comfortable .\\nCode status - the patient is a DNR / DNI .\\nThis is an unfortunate case but Mr. Po does have an incredibly supportive family who have been here consistently to visit him and that offers him an important source of comfort .\\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :\\nTylenol , 650 mg p.o. q 4 prn ; Allopurinol , 100 mg p.o. q.d. ; Peridex mouthwash , 10 ml b.i.d.; cholysteramineresin , 4 grams p.o. q.d. ; clotrimazole , one troche p.o. q.i.d. ; Fentanyl patch , 100 mcg per hour topical q 72 hours ; glipizide , 10 mg p.o. q.d.; Atarax , 25 operating table 50 mg p.o. q 6 to 8 hours prn itching ; regular sliding scale insulin ; KBL mouthwash , 15 ccp .o. q.d. prn mouth discomfort ; Lactulose , 30 ml p.o. q.i.d. that was started on January 30 , for no bowel movements with instructions to continue until bowel movement and then decrease to b.i.d. or q.d. ; Lidocaine , 2% , 10 ml UR q 3 to 4 hours prn for pain around Foley site ; Ativan , 0.25 to 0.5 mg IV q 4 to 6 hours prn anxiety with instructions to use caution .\\nThe patient gets very somnolent with Ativan .\\nMaalox Plus , Extra Strength , 15 cc p.o. q 6 hours prn indigestion ; magnesium sulfate ; sliding scale IV and potassium chloride , sliding scale IV .\\nHe is also on Reglan , 10 mg p.o. q h ; Miracle topical cream to affected area ; also Sarna , topical cream , b.i.d.\\nHe has Nystatin suspension mouthwash , 10 cc swish and swallow q.i.d.

Atonic bladder with a suprapubic tube .\\n2. Anxiety .\\n3. Coronary artery disease with a history of angina in the distant past .\\n4. History of colon cancer with a colectomy in the past .\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\\n1. Ativan 1 mg po twice a day .\\n2. Trusopt 1 gtt left eye three times a day .\\n3.

NUTRITIONAL STATUS .\\n7) THROMBOCYTOPENIA STATUS POST BONE MARROW TRANSPLANT .\\n8) MULTIPLE MYELOMA .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nThis is a 59-year-old white male .\\nThe patient has had multiple myeloma since 1990 .\\nHe underwent an autologous bone marrow transplant in 10/92 at Petersly Hospital And Medical Center .\\nAt that time he received total body irradiation of 1400 cGy .\\nThis bone marrow transplant did not produce remission and then he was treated with three cycles of VAD subsequently .\\nIn 08/94 , the patient developed lower back pain .\\nA workup done in DE is not available at the time of this dictation .\\nAccording to her scanty records , an MRI of the spine showed diffuse spinal column involvement with lesions in T4 and T8 with no cord compression at that time .\\nHe was then treated with radiation therapy from T3 to T9 receiving 2500 cGy from 08/94 to 09/94 .\\nHe has been on Decadron since 08/94 .\\nAbout two weeks prior to admission the patient developed mid back pain , burning in nature with radiation around the right lower ribs .\\nHe also began to develop noticeably increasing bilateral lower extremity weakness and possibly numbness in the lower extremities .\\nHe stated that he had difficulty rising from a chair .\\nAn MRI without gadolinium done on 11/20/94 of the spine showed a right posterior lateral epidural mass extending from T9 to T12 .\\nThere was evidence of cord compression .\\nThe patient &apos;s Decadron dose was increased to 12 mg q day and he was also started on MS Contin and radiation therapy was being planned and arranged at the Petersly Hospital And Medical Center .\\nHowever , one day prior to admission the patient developed right lower extremity pain and could not walk secondary to the pain .\\nOver the next 12 hours while in transit to the hospital , the patient &apos;s right lower extremity became red , swollen , and increasingly painful .\\nHe has had chronic bilateral lower extremity swelling since his transplant but the right lower extremity swelling was noticeably increased .\\nHe also complained of some fecal incontinence the day prior to admission without urinary incontinence .\\nAt the time of presentation the patient denied headache , arm weakness , changes in vision , dysarthria , abdominal pain , nausea or vomiting , chest pain or shortness of breath .\\nHe was taken to Huyychestleme Health Of in Scoo , Utah where he had a temperature of 99.9 , blood pressure 90/50 , heart rate 128 , and O2 sat of 91% on room air .\\nBlood cultures , urine culture , and UA were all done .\\nBlood cultures drawn on admission subsequently grew Pseudomonas aeruginosa .\\nHe was treated with Ceftazidime , gentamicin , and Vancomycin and also was started on a Dopamine drip for treatment of his sepsis .\\nA Swan was placed and initial readings were CVP of 6 , wedge pressure of 10 to 12 , cardiac index of 4.7 , and SVR of 438 all consistent with a Pseudomonas sepsis picture .\\nHe was given stress steroids and was subsequently transferred to Lorough Medical Center &apos;s Intensive Care Unit for further management .\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\n1) Multiple myeloma .\\n2) Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation .\\n3) Plasmacytoma of T9 through T12 .\\n4) Chronic renal insufficiency .\\n5) Chronically low platelet count .\\n6) Failed autologous bone marrow transplant in 10/92 .\\n7) Hypothyroidism .\\nFAMILY HISTORY :\\nPositive for diabetes mellitus .\\nSOCIAL HISTORY :\\nMarried to a very supportive wife .\\nALLERGIES :\\nQuestion of penicillin and sulfa drugs leading to a rash .\\nMEDICATIONS :\\nOn transfer include Vancomycin , Ceftazidime , gentamicin , Solu Cortef 100 mg q8h , Lasix , Synthroid , insulin , MS Contin 60 mg b.i.d. , MSO4 2 mg p.r.n. pain IV , Dopamine 12 mcg per minute .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nOn admission showed a non-toxic appearing male with temperature 99.5 , blood pressure 82/50 , heart rate 118 , respiratory rate 15 .\\nHEENT exam atraumatic , no oral lesions .\\nNeck supple , carotids without bruits .\\nCardiac exam was regular S1 and S2 , no murmur .\\nChest clear to auscultation with a few fine crackles at the left base .\\nAbdomen non-distended , positive bowel sounds , soft , non-tender , no hepatosplenomegaly or masses .\\nRectal normal tone , guaiac positive brown stool , no perirectal lesions or erythema .\\nExtremities reveal the right lower extremity was tense , purple-red , swollen , and was warm from the knee to the ankle and extremely tender .\\nThere was pitting edema of both lower extremities but no evidence of cellulitis of the left lower extremity .\\nNeurological exam on admission revealed he was drowsy but easily arousable to voice , oriented to person , Retelk County Medical Center , and date , able to say no but mildly inattentive during examination .\\nCranial nerves intact .\\nMotor exam normal tone , positive asterixis , no drift .\\nStrength was decreased in both lower extremities .\\nCoordination was normal with good finger to nose , gait was not tested .\\nDeep tendon reflexes were 2+ in the upper extremities , 1+ in the patella reflexes , no reflexes at the ankles , upgoing Babinski toes bilaterally .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nOn admission revealed white blood cell count 4.2 , Hct 27 , platelet count 28 .\\nGlucose 191 .\\nPT 17.6 , PTT 48.7 , fibrinogen 686 , TT 39.2 .\\nMagnesium 1.7 .\\nUA showed no white blood cells , positive granular casts .\\nChest x-ray was without infiltrates , wand in good position .\\nAn MRI was performed upon admission and showed an epidural mass at the right posterior lateral T9 to T12 area invading the neural foramina .\\nThere was no CSF density .\\nThese findings were consistent with the cord compression .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nBy problems -\\n1) INFECTIOUS DISEASE / CELLULITIS :\\nThe patient &apos;s clinical situation was most consistent with a Pseudomonas cellulitis and subsequent sepsis .\\nBlood cultures drawn at the outside hospital grew out Pseudomonas that was sensitive to Imipenem and Tobramycin .\\nThere were cultures obtained seeping from the wound at Retelk County Medical Center and those also grew out Pseudomonas aeruginosa .\\nThe organism grown at this institution was sensitive to Imipenem , Ceftazidime , Amikacin , gentamicin , Ciprofloxacin , Tobramycin but was resistant to Cefotetan , Ceftriaxone , Mezlocillin , Bactrim , Ampicillin , chloramphenicol , and sulbactam .\\nHe was treated initially with Ceftazidime and gentamicin but there was a question about the organism &apos;s susceptibility from lab studies done at the outside hospital .\\nHe was subsequently switched to Imipenem and Tobramycin and was maintained on those medications throughout the hospital course .\\nThe Tobramycin and Imipenem were started on 11/25/94 .\\nIn addition , the patient received a five day course of intravenous IgG to improve infection control .\\nVancomycin was also added to his regimen on 11/28/94 and this was primarily to provide improved MRSA coverage as he continued to have erythema along the lateral right lower extremity .\\nHe was evaluated by the Surgery Department and it is there feeling that there is no indication for surgical intervention / amputation at this time .\\nHe is being maintained with twice daily Xeroform with Betadine changes .\\nThese dressing changes are applied by applying the Xeroform on Betadine initially and then changing it with sterile dry bandages .\\nOf note , the patient has extreme pain with these dressing changes and requires parenteral morphine sulfate for pain control during dressing changes .\\nThe plan is to complete a full course of Imipenem and Tobramycin for his Pseudomonas cellulitis .\\nAs mentioned earlier he continues to have erythema tracking up his leg and up to his lateral thigh .\\nThe cause of this erythema is not know at this time but has not shown extensive progression .\\n2) CARDIOVASCULAR :\\nThe patient was initially treated with Dopamine which was subsequently weaned off after his sepsis improved .\\nHe was noted to be in rapid AF on several episodes receiving 5 mg IV Lopressor each time with improvement .\\nHe has been in and out of atrial fibrillation and normal sinus rhythm .\\nAn echocardiogram performed at the outside hospital while he was septic showed decreased global EF .\\nThe patient is being maintained on Digoxin for his paroxysmal atrial fibrillation .\\nHe has had no significant episode of tachycardia or blood pressure alteration during the final days of hospitalization .\\nThe plan is to continue the Digoxin and to recheck an echocardiogram to assess his ejection fraction when he is clinically better .\\n3) ONCOLOGY :\\nThe patient has a plasmacytoma affecting the spine .\\nHe has been receiving radiation therapy to that area during the hospital stay .\\nThe plan is to complete a full course of XRT to the spinal region for the plasmacytoma .\\nThe patient &apos;s lesion compressing his thoracic spine was never biopsied , however , the MRI appearance does not seem to be infectious and is most consistent with plasmacytoma for which he is receiving the radiation therapy .\\n4) NEUROLOGIC :\\nAs mentioned above he has a cord compression and is on steroids .\\nHe was initially treated with IV Decadron 10 mg up front and then 6 mg q6h.\\nHis neurological exam remained stable with no evidence of increasing lower extremity edema .\\nHis Decadron dose was titrated down to 5 mg IV q6h on 12/3/94 .\\nHis Decadron dose will be slowly titrated down over time following his neurological exam closely .\\n5) BLOOD SUGARS :\\nThe patient has steroid induced diabetes mellitus .\\nHe has been on increasing doses of insulin receiving NPH in the morning and night in addition to a CZI sliding scale on a q6h basis .\\nThe plan is to continue the supplemental insulin while he is on steroids and while his sugars remain high .\\n6) RESPIRATORY :\\nHe initially required a face mask to keep his saturation above 90% .\\nHowever , with increasing diuresis and improving septic pictures his O2 saturations have improved and he is now on nasal cannula and will be maintained on nasal cannula to keep his sat above 93% .\\nHe can be given intravenous Lasix as needed for any evidence of respiratory compromise or increasing pulmonary edema .\\n7) NUTRITION :\\nThe patient has a poor nutritional status with hypoalbuminemia .\\nHe has been maintained on tube feeds and that should be continued .\\nHe should also be encouraged to eat as much as possible orally in addition to this tube feeds and aspiration precaution should be maintained .\\n8) ELEVATED PT and PTT :\\nBoth of these responded to three day course of vitamin K 10 mg each day .\\nHis PT and PTT are now normal , however , he continues to run a low platelet count .\\nThis has been evident since the time of his bone marrow transplant .\\nWe have been transfusing him with platelets to keep his counts above 20,000 to reduce his bleeding risk .\\nHe also received several blood transfusions while here to maintain his Hct around 30 .\\nThrombocytopenic inducing drugs should be avoided if possible on this patient .\\nDISPOSITION :\\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :\\nTylenol 650 mg po q4h p.r.n. , Dulcolax 10 mg per rectum b.i.d. p.r.n. , Decadron 5 mg IV q6h , Digoxin 0.25

nephrostomy tube placement transferred to Retelk County Medical Center for further management .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nMr. Prehekote is an 88-year-old Portuguese speaking only male who was diagnosed with adenocarcinoma of the prostate in 1998 .\\nHe received transurethral resection of the prostate one year ago because of persistent urinary retention .\\nAfter that , he was on Lupron and Nilandron hormone therapy .\\nThe patient was admitted on February 23 , 1999 to Eifro Medical Center because of failure to thrive and decreased hematocrit .\\nHe was noted to have elevated BUN and creatinine .\\nBUN was 34 and creatinine was 2.6 , up from his baseline of 1.0 .\\nProstate specific antigen increased from 77.9 to 88 , and the patient also had urinary incontinence and body weight loss .\\nFurther evaluation of his renal failure showed that the patient has bilateral hydronephrosis , most likely obstructive uropathy due to prostate CA in the pelvic area .\\nBecause of the increasing creatinine to 8.0 on February 28 , 1999 , a left nephrostomy tube was placed .\\nHowever after the procedure , the patient &apos;s hematocrit dropped to 24 and he was transfused two units of packed red blood cells .\\nHis hematocrit increased to about 30 , but he continued to have hematuria and his renal function only improved very slowly .\\nHe also received Kayexalate for hyperkalemia .\\nDue to the persistent blood in the urine , he was transferred from Eifro Medical Center to the Retelk County Medical Center for angiographic studies to rule out any vascular injuries .\\nThe patient was transferred to Genearocktemp Ry Health on March 3 , 1999 .\\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS :\\nThe patient had constipation with dysuria , but no fever or chills .\\nNo cough .\\nNo chest pain .\\nNo palpitations , history of epigastric pain and body weight loss .\\nNo headache .\\nNo bone pain .\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\n1) Hypertension .\\n2) Gastroesophageal reflux disease .\\n3) Anemia

patient has been living in the Kansas for more than 20 years .\\nHe was originally from Wark and he speaks Portuguese only .\\nHe is now living with his son and daughter , and five other children .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nOn admission , the patient was a frail looking elderly male lying in bed in no acute distress .\\nTemperature 95.4 , pulse 120 , blood pressure 150/80 , respiratory rate 24 , 95% on room air .\\nConjunctiva were not pale .\\nSclera nonicteric .\\nPupils :\\nIsocoric cataract bilaterally .\\nMouth :\\nMucous membranes slightly dry .\\nNo oral ulcers .\\nNeck :\\nSupple

grade II / VI systolic ejection murmur at the left sternal border .\\nAbdomen :\\nSoft .\\nLiver and spleen were not palpable .\\nBowel sounds normoactive .\\nExtremities :\\nTraced pitting edema .\\nNo cyanosis and no clubbing .\\nPeripheral pulses were very strong and bounding .\\nNo calf tenderness .\\nHoman &apos;s sign negative .\\nNeurologic :\\nExamination was limited because the patient speaks only Portuguese .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nOn admission the patient &apos;s biochemistry showed sodium of 140 , potassium 4.0 , chloride 107 , bicarb 14 , BUN 63 , creatinine 5.8 , blood sugar 133 .\\nLiver function test showed AST 21 , alkaline phosphatase 70 , total bilirubin 0.3 , total protein 6.5 , albumin 3.9 , globulin 2.6 .\\nCBC :\\nWBC 8.4 , hematocrit 32.6 , platelet count 194,000 .\\nPT 11.9 , INR 1.0 , PTT 28.4 .\\nChest x-ray showed no evidence of cardiomegaly .\\nNo lung infiltrate .\\nCT scan of the renal area showed right hydronephrosis which extends to an asymmetrically thickened urinary bladder wall .\\nA mass like thickening of the urinary bladder suggestive of either detrusor hypertrophy or possibly tumor .\\nThe CT scan showed a cavitary lung lesion in the right lower lobe compatible with metastatic or septic embolus .\\nEKG showed atrial fibrillation , left axis deviation , LVH , nonspecific ST-T changes either due to digitalis affect .\\nCK enzymes 146 .\\nRepeated three times and remained flat .\\nTroponin I on the second day of admission was 1.18 .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nAfter admission , urology , nephrology as well as interventional radiology was consulted about the management of this patient .\\nThe specialist concluded that because the patient &apos;s hematuria seemed to be stable and hematocrit to maintain at about 29-30 , there is no urgent need to do an arteriogram which may cause further damage to the patient &apos;s kidney .\\nUrology consultation thinks that cystoscopy would not add any benefit to the management and only would consider a right nephrostomy if renal function failed to improve .\\nAfter admission , the patient was treated conservatively to correct his electrolyte and metabolic acidosis .\\nHe was given blood transfusion , two units when his hematocrit dropped to 29.4 .\\nAfter transfusion , the patient &apos;s hematocrit rose to 37.7 on the day of discharge .\\nThe patient was also given sodium bicarbonate to correct his metabolic acidosis .\\nHe continued to pass about 1500-2000 cc of urine a day and his renal function improved slowly with creatinine decreased to 4.2 on the day of discharge .\\nDuring this admission , the patient also developed atrial fibrillation with ventricular rate of about 70-80 .\\nCPK was tracked , but was totally normal .\\nNo beta blockers were given .\\nA long discussion amongst the specialist , nephrology , urology , interventional radiology , primary oncology as well with the family lead to the conclusion that conservative management may give the patient more comfort than crisis treatment in this well advanced prostate CA .\\nDr. Lucreamull discussed the patient &apos;s clinical status and overall situation with the patient &apos;s family and the family decided that Mr. Prehekote could return home with hospice .\\nThe patient &apos;s primary care physician , Dr. Tomedankell Flowayles will manage the hospice issues .\\nThe patient was discharged to home for hospice on March 8 , 1999 .\\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :\\nBethanechol 25 milligrams p.o. t.i.d. , Clonidine 2.5 milligrams topical q. week , apply every

When his O2 saturation was monitored , his pulse oximetry remained in the 90s during his stay .\\n2. His non-essential medications that may have been contributing to his change in mental status were discontinued ; those included Temocillin , Nortriptyline , Haldol , Lorazepam , Venlafaxine , Bupropion , and Gabapentin .\\nIn addition , his cyclosporin levels were checked .\\n3. Hypo or hyperglycemia :\\nMahoney had been following with their appreciated recommendations on glucose control .\\nFinger sticks were in the 150 s when acutely agitated , therefore , it was not determined that glucose levels were contributory .\\n4. Infectious causes were evaluated .\\nHe was febrile in the Intensive Care Unit to 101.0 F. ; yet , chest x-ray , blood cultures , urinalysis and urine cultures were all negative for sources .\\nA lumbar puncture was considered , although not performed due to the fact that the cerebrospinal fluid was not breached during the procedure .\\n5. Mass effect was considered , although no focal deficits were ever noted on examination and due to the fluctuating sensorium , it was determined that there was no severe underlying structural abnormality .\\nA head and neck CT scan , non-contrast , were ordered though to evaluate for such processes .\\nNo acute intracranial hemorrhages or midline shifts were noted , although a soft tissue mass was noted at the level of C2 .\\nThis was determined to be within the normal expected changes post surgery .\\n6. Trauma was also considered .\\nThe patient was found out of bed but no signs of head trauma , no loss of consciousness .\\nThroughout his stay , Chem-10 was monitored .\\nThere were no electrolytes or mineral abnormalities that could explain his delirium .\\nLiver function tests were checked , only total bilirubin was slightly elevated at 1.6 .\\nTSH was within normal limits as was B12 and folate .\\nRPR evaluating for possible neurologic syphilis was also checked .\\nThe assay was nonreactive .\\nAn EEG was also considered to rule out non-convulsive status epilepticus , although again this did not seem to be a likely cause .\\nOn the evening of the 22nd , the patient became acutely agitated , threatening to leave , and also threatening to harm those nurses and physicians that were attempting to prevent him from leaving .\\nSecurity was notified who then arrived to the room and helped to place the patient in four-point\\nrestraints , for the safety of both the patient and the staff of the hospital .\\nThe restraints were weaned off overnight although he became acutely agitated and they were replaced early on 08-31 .\\nLater in the morning on 08-31 , the patient was more oriented and alert , and asked to have the restraints removed .\\nThey were taken off two at a time .\\nThe patient continued to do well and did not require restraints after that event .\\nIntramuscular as well as intravenous Haldol were ordered p.r.n. for emergency use should he become acutely agitated .\\nhaldol as well as the restraints were not required after the morning of the 23rd .\\nEach progressive day,  Mr. Donald delirium abated with return to baseline mental status early on 09-01 .\\nThe likely cause of the delirium was a combination of surgery and Intensive Care Unit stay in addition to poly-pharmacy .\\nOther concerns during his stay was his kidney function , due to his renal transplant in 2003 .\\nHis immunosuppressive therapy was continued throughout his stay ; his creatinine remained approximately 2.3 to 2.4 ; he has a baseline renal insufficiency .\\nWith this in mind , when obtaining a CT scan it was determined that contrast would not be the best option .\\nWhile the patient was in restraints , gentle hydration was initiated since p.o. intake was not adequate .\\nAs for his diabetes mellitus , the Mahoney Team provided updated recommendations each day , adjusting for the changing p.o. intake .\\nThe only other complaints from Mr. Mackey during his stay were :\\nSoreness at his operative sites , for which he was given p.r.n. Tylenol once his delirium had resolved .\\nIn addition , he also complained of difficulty with swallowing , necessitating only soft and liquid diet .\\nThis was attributed to postoperative swelling and changes from his diskectomy performed 2010-08-27 .\\nDISPOSITION :\\nThe patient was discharged on 09-02 .\\nDISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS :\\n1. Follow-up with Dr. Williams on Tuesday , 09-07 , at noon .\\n2. Follow-up with Dr. Michael , his psychiatrist , on Wednesday , 09-08 .\\n3. He was also discharged home with Visiting Nurse Association for Physical Therapy evaluation of home safety .\\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :\\n1. Venlafaxine XR 75 mg q. a.m.\\n2.

neck is supple with no lymphadenopathy .\\nThe chest is clear to auscultation bilaterally .\\nThe heart has a regular rate and rhythm with normal S1 , S2 .\\nThere is no murmurs .\\nThe abdomen was soft , nontender , no masses and nondistended .\\nThere is no hepatosplenomegaly .\\nRectal exam showed no masses and is guaiac negative .\\nThe extremities have distal pulses and were warm and well perfused .\\nNeurological exam was grossly intact .\\nLABORATORY STUDIES AT ADMISSION :\\nA white blood cell count of 14.2 , hematocrit of 35.3 , platelet count of 449,000 .\\nSodium of 130 , potassium 3.5 , chloride 93 , bicarbonate 28 , BUN 15 , creatinine 1.1, prothrombin time 14.1 , partial thrombin time 29.7 .\\nINR 1.4 .\\nALT 106 , AST 149 , alkaline phosphatase 242 .\\nTotal

po contrast showed dilation of intrahepatic common bile duct which is improved from previous studies .\\nIt is also noted that there was splenomegaly .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nMr. Cordano was admitted on 2009-08-17 for a replacement of transhepatic biliary drainage catheter .\\nAt that time , cholangiogram confirmed that there was a distal stricture of the common bile duct .\\nAn endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography also demonstrated similar findings\\nand it is noted there was nodularity in the common bile duct which is worrisome for cholangiocarcinoma .\\nTherefore , the patient was taken to the Operating Room on 2009-08-24 for a Whipple procedure versus hepaticojejunostomy .\\nOn exploration of the abdomen revealed significant nodularity of the liver indicating of advanced cirrhosis .\\nIntraoperative frozen section of the distal and proximal common bile duct in the\\nregion nodularity , which is identified previously by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography , and regional lymph nodes were all sent to pathology .\\nThey were all negative for malignancy and therefore a hepaticojejunostomy\\nwas performed .\\nCholangiogram on postoperative day number two showed no evidence of leakage at the anastomosis site .\\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well and he was sent to the floor in stable condition .\\nThe patient 's postoperative course was notable for an elevation in white blood cell count peaking at 30.0 on postoperative day number two .\\nHe was given Unasyn for empiric antibiotic treatment .\\nAt the time , blood , urine and bile was sent for culture , which were all negative .\\nA chest x-ray was also negative for any pneumonia .\\nPostoperatively , Mr. Cordano also suffered from low urine output ranges between 25 to 30 cc per hour .\\nFractional excretion of sodium was less than 1% suggesting a prerenal etiology .\\nThe sodium creatinine peaked at 2.0 and the patient was treated with boluses of intravenous fluid and intravenous albumin infusion was also administered .\\nHe responded well to this regimen and made adequate urine output .\\nAt the same time , the patient also developed distentions of the abdomen consistent with accumulation of ascitic fluid .\\nHe also had significant lower extremity and scrotum edema .\\nOn postoperative day number eight , the patient 's oxygen saturation dropped to 85% on room air and he was transferred to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit for fluid management .\\nChest x-ray and sputum culture obtained at the time were negative and the patient was treated with 100% nonrebreather which improved his oxygenation .\\nWhile he is in the Surgical Intensive Care Unit , paracentesis was performed and it\\nrevealed greater than 24,000 white blood cell count in the ascites which is consistent with SVT .\\nHe was given Zosyn for empiric treatment .\\nGram stain and culture of the ascites failed to identify any organism .\\nHe was weaned from oxygen requirement and was continued on normal saline boluses and\\nintravenous albumin for treatment of prerenal azotemia .\\nSomatostatin and midodrine were also given for this condition and he also received packed red blood cells .\\nOn postoperative day number ten , the patient returned to the floor with improved renal function and without oxygen requirement .\\nThe somatostatin and the midodrine were discontinued and the regimen of Lasix and spironolactone was started for diuresis .\\nHis creatinine levels trended toward normal and the fractional excretion of sodium also increased indicating a resolution of the prerenal kidney failure .\\nOn postoperative day number 17 , the patient was discharged .\\nAt the time he took good po .\\nHe has a PICC line in place for continued

of hypercholesterolemia and type II diabetes mellitus .\\nHe has a recent history of dyspnea on exertion on exertional chest pain which has increased over the last several weeks and is relieved by sublingual nitroglycerin .\\nOn 2016-06-26 , he had a positive exercise tolerance test .\\nCardiac catheterization at the end of October revealed a dilated aortic root to 4.4 cm and 80% stenosis of the mid left anterior descending at the bifurcation involving the diagonal branch , 70% stenoses of the left circumflex and oblique marginal artery and 90% stenosis of the posterior descending artery .\\nHis atrioventricular valve gradient was 27 with an AV surface area of .91 .\\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS :\\nReview of systems shows that the patient denies any orthopnea , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea .\\nHe has no bleeding or clotting problems .\\nJuanita does not feel any palpitations .\\nHe does not have wheezing , claudication or gastrointestinal bleeding .\\nNor does he have any history of

mg once a day .\\nLipitor 10 mg once a day .\\nSOCIAL HISTORY :\\nHe lives with his wife and works as a drug representative for Carvedilol .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nOn physical examination , the patient is afebrile .\\nWeight is 82 kilograms .\\nBlood pressure 126/66 .\\nGeneral :\\nActive , well-developed , well-nourished male .\\nHead and neck examination :\\nNo bruits appreciated .\\nLungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally .\\nHeart was regular rate and rhythm .\\nS1 and S2 .\\n3/6 systolic ejection murmur throughout his precordium .\\nHis abdomen is soft , nontender , nondistended .\\nNo hepatosplenomegaly and no CVA tenderness .\\nExtremities are warm , well perfused , no cyanosis , clubbing or\\nedema .\\nPalpable dorsalis pedis pulses .\\nNo varicosities noted .\\nThe patient was also noted to be right handed .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nHe was admitted to the cardiac surgery service for an elected Bental procedure with homograft and coronary artery bypass graft .\\nOnce consent and preoperative evaluation was complete , he was taken to the operating room .\\nPlease refer to the previously dictated operative note of 2016-12-30 by Dr. Lawrence .\\nBriefly , the patient was taken to the operating room to repair his critical aortic stenosis , his coronary artery disease and his significantly dilated ascending aortic aneurysm .\\nThe procedure was an aortic valve replacement with a tissue valve , a coronary artery bypass graft procedure where five grafts were performed .\\nThe left internal mammary artery was connected to the proximal left anterior descending and saphenous vein grafts were connected to the posterior descending artery , diagonal branch , obtuse marginal and distal left anterior descending .\\nFinally , a super coronary arch graft was implanted .\\nThis was a .................... graft .\\nCardiopulmonary bypass time was 234 minutes .\\nHis aorta was cross clamped for 168 minutes .\\nHe had pharmacologic circulatory arrest for 18 minutes .\\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the unit , intubated on Milrinone , Levophed and Propofol drips .\\nThe rest of the hospital stay can be discussed in terms of system based approach .\\nPulmonary :\\nThe patient remained intubated until postoperative day number five .\\nAfter that , the patient had no major problems with his lungs .\\nHis oxygen saturations remained good and he did not require supplemental oxygen more than a couple of days after his extubation .\\nHe was sent to the floor from the cardiac surgery recovery unit on postoperative day number seven .\\nAfter an extended stay for hemodynamic monitoring and pressor support to maintain his perfusion .\\nNeurologic :\\nThe major neurologic event of this hospital course was that the patient was slow to awake after his Propofol drip was discontinued .\\nBecause of his confusion , a neurology consult was obtained and subsequent radiographic imaging revealed chronic appearing infarcts in the right occipital lobe as well as both cerebellar hemispheres , suggestive of more chronic infarcts , as well as an area in the left corona radiata , adjacent to the left lateral ventricle which may or may not be an acute infarct .\\nThis was seen on the CAT scan on postoperative day number one , 12-31 .\\nAs the patient became more awake , he still remained somewhat confused and a little bit out of it .\\nIn addition , he was noted to have a right sided hemiplegia .\\nOver his postoperative course , Mr. Douglass has gradually been able to utilize more and more of his right side and with the assistance of physical therapy and occupational therapy , he has 4 to 5 + strength in his right hand and arm and about 4 + strength in his right leg .\\nHe is able to walk about the floor on the days prior to discharge , with the assistance of the physical therapist and nurses .\\nIn addition , Mr. Douglass is given Trazodone to help him sleep at night .\\nA psychiatric consult was also obtained due to his mental status and confusion postoperatively but his psychiatric issues are mostly related to his neurologic insults and he has no distinctive psychiatric disorder , except for perhaps postoperative delirium .\\nCardiovascularly , the patient did extremely well following the surgery .\\nThe Levophed drip was continued until postoperative day number one .\\nMilrinone was continued until postoperative day number three , at which point he was having good enough cardiac output that he did not need these drips to help maintain his blood pressure anymore .\\nHe has remained without any chest pain following this procedure and his sternal wound is clean , dry and intact at the end of the procedure .\\nIn addition , he has hypertension , for which he receives Metoprolol and he has hypercholesterolemia , for which he receives nothing at this time .\\nPulmonary :\\nThe patient remained intubated until postoperative day number five .\\nHe was diuresed and was soon saturating very well on room air .\\nGastrointestinal :\\nThe patient has gastroesophageal reflux disease , for which he has been receiving Zantac as an inpatient .\\nWe will put him back on his Nexium .\\nIn addition , over the last couple of days prior to discharge , the patient did appear a little bit icteric .\\nLiver function tests were obtained and they were slightly elevated liver function tests and ALT was 44 , AST was 34 ; alkaline phosphatase was 199 , within normal limits .\\nTotal bilirubin was 2.8 .\\nAmylase was 108 and lipase was 213 .\\nA right upper quadrant ultrasound did not reveal any gallstones or common bile duct dilatation indicative of cholecystitis or cholelithiasis .\\nIn addition , the patient did have slightly elevated blood sugars over the last couple of days and has required an insulin sliding scale and basal insulin to maintain his blood sugars at a more appropriate level .\\nThe ideal blood sugar levels for Mr. Douglass in this postoperative period should be less than 140 .\\nPlease stay on top of the sliding scale so that the patient can keep a euglycemic level .\\nHematologic :\\nThe patient , during this admission , required transfusion of three units of packed red blood cells to maintain adequate hematocrit .\\nAt the time of discharge , Mr. Norman hematocrit is at 40.7 .\\nFluids , electrolytes and nutrition :\\nThe patient did receive a significant amount of diuresis postoperatively and is well below his baseline with weight , most likely because of his inability to eat because of his stroke .\\nOnce he was coherent enough , the patient was evaluated by the swallow team who\\ndeclared him at first an aspiration risk .\\nAs Mr. Douglass has improved from his initial stroke , he has become more lucid\\nand is less of an aspiration risk .\\nOn 01-12 , one day prior to discharge , he was cleared by the swallow team to eat\\na diet as he wishes .\\nHe is going out on a cardiac healthy , diabetic diet , as tolerated with Boost supplements .\\nInfectious disease :\\nThe patient had positive blood and urine cultures on 01-05 for history of Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus , which was pan sensitive .\\nHe was started on Oct. 25 for this bug .\\nOn 01-08 , the patient 's central venous line was discontinued .\\nThe catheterization tip also grew out Serratia .\\nOn the 16th , a urine culture was obtained and did grow out greater than 100,000 colonies of E. coli which was intermittently resistant to Ciprofloxacin .\\nHe was started on Bactrim for that .\\nPlease continue Mr. David Montero for one month to fight his blood borne infection , to prevent seeding of his aortic graft and continue Bactrim for ten days after discharge to treat the E. coli in his urine .\\nDISPOSITION :\\nMr. Douglass is being discharged on 2017-01-13 to a rehabilitation facility in good condition .\\nFOLLOW-UP :\\nOne to two weeks with his primary care physician and two to three weeks with his cardiologist and at one month with Dr. Costello .\\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSES :\\nCoronary artery disease , status post coronary artery bypass graft .\\nCritical aortic stenosis , status post aortic valve replacement .\\nAortic arch aneurysm , status post aortic arch graft .\\nAcute postoperative delirium .\\nPerioperative stroke .\\nChronic blood loss anemia and chronic RBC transfusion

SOB : Most consistent with CHF by exam , although unknown what the severity of her COPD is currently .\\nTTE revealed large pericardial effusion .\\nPt is now s/p drainage of right pleural effusion , diagnostic and therapeutic , with studies consistent with transudate , etiology most likely 02-15 CHF .\\nWe continued her albuterol / atrovent nebs , diuresis with IV lasix drip and boluses .\\nHer 05-27 CXR post procedure w/o PNX , effusion much improved , yet her 05-28 CXR worse than 05-27 with some reaccumulation of right pleural effusion .\\nThen , on 05-29 , she demonstrated bilateral pleural effusions ( reaccumulated ), right lower lobe infiltrate ( started on vanco / zosyn )-> put on face mask , given lasix x 1 bolus 100 mg , responded somewhat and o2 sat stable in low 90 s.\\nShe was given 200 mg IV lasix X 1 with an additional 100 cc of urine output the evening of 5/16 .\\nHer lasix gtt continued during this time .\\nHer oxygen sats did not improve .\\nShe was then made CMO .\\nSee above .\\n#. Pericardial effusion : unclear etiology , OSH had raised question of RV perforation from pacer , however she had a normal echo appearance of lead , no tamponade by exam .\\nThis has still be known to occur during the placement of pacemaker .\\nIt was felt posthumously that her large pericardial effusion was most likely secondary to a complication of pacer placement , although this was not seen on imaging .\\nIn the last 12 hours of her life , her pulsus was 12 , and she was felt to likely to have aspect of tamponade physiology , since her preload was reduced .\\n#.

Hypotension : The patient 'd pm BP meds were held 11-14 and she was administered 1.5L NS over the course of the day with subsequent SBP s in the high 90 s, low 100 s,.\\nThe hypotension was likely due to volume depletion caused by her diarrhea / loose stools in addition to decreased PO intake secondary to her GERD and thrush .\\nAll of this occurred in the setting of aggressive BP management with metoprolol 25 BID , HCTZ / Triampterene ( as a replacment for lasix due to recurrent hypokalemia ), Benicar 20 mg QD , and Imdur 30 mg QD .\\nInfection / sepsis was not likely given she was afebrile and had no localizing sx with an improving lung exam and 02 requirement .\\nGiven the patient 's recent RP bleed , there was concern for a recurrent bleed .\\nHer groin exam was unchanged .\\nHer Hct dropped from Hct 38.9 before fluids to 35.5 s/p 1.5L NS and was thought to be dilutional .\\nRepeat hcts were stable .\\nThe patient was kept an additional two days to follow her hcts and titrate her BP meds .\\nAs volume depletion was thought to be the cause of her low BP , only the BBlocker was restarted .\\nShe was also placed on on low dose spironolactone as a K sparing diuretic and for BP control in addition to Toprol XL 25 mg QD for her coronary disease .\\nShe tolerated these meds with SBP s in the high 90 s to 100 s and was therefore discharged on this regimen .\\nShe will need follow up with her PCP within B week after discharge from the extended care facility for further BP titration and monitoring of her electrolytes .\\n2. Thrush : This is likely secondary to her steroid inhalers and PO prednisone for COPD exacerbation .\\nShe was started on nystatin swish and swallow QID .\\nThe patient was encouraged to take PO liquids to prevent volume depletion .\\n3. diarrhea : The patient has been having loose stools at night and was guiac pos x 2 .\\nStool for C.diff toxin was sent x 1 and was negative .\\nHer bowel regimen is prn .\\nGastroenteritis is possible but she has no vomiting and only occ nausea with meds .\\nThere is no evidence of obstruction on AXR .\\nTherefore , the cause of her mild diarrhea ( few loose BM / liquid stool / night ) may be either viral or secondary to resolving abdominal hematoma with resultant irritation of GI system .\\nWe have advised a BRAT diet .\\n4. guiac pos stool : Given the patient 's sx of GERD , current PO steroid regimen , and ASA for her stents , the ddx for her guiac positive stools would include gastritis / gastric ulcer in addition to lower GI pathology .\\nHowever , she has no vomiting and only mild nausea with medications .\\nShe also has no gross blood per rectum and her hct is stable .\\nUpon discharge the patient was changed to a BID protonix regimen .\\nDr. Valerio office was notified about the patient 's discharge plans and status .\\nShe will need outpatient follow up for her guiac pos stools with endoscopy vs EGD +/- H.pylori serologies .\\nA copy of this dc summary will be faxed to her PCP to ensure proper follow up .\\nDischarge Medications :\\n1.

CT Chest 2017-09-16 :\\n1. Increasing large right-sided pleural effusion and pulmonary edema .\\nScattered parenchymal opacities in the left lower lobe represent superimposed infection vs atelectasis .\\nThere is no evidence of abscess .\\n6. 2017-09-28 Chest X Ray :\\nSINGLE AP VIEW OF THE CHEST .\\nThere has been almost complete resolution of pulmonary edema .\\nA small right pleural effusion has decreased in size .\\nMild cardiomegaly is stable .\\nThere is no pneumothorax .\\nRight PIC catheter tip ends in the lower SVC .\\nPatient is post median sternotomy .\\nIMPRESSION :\\nAlmost complete resolution of pulmonary edema .\\n7. 2017-09-29 CT Head :\\nFINDINGS :\\nThere is no evidence of intraaxial or extraaxial hemorrhage , mass effect , shift of normally midline structures , or acute major or minor vascular territorial infarction .\\nThe ventricles and sulci are mildly prominent , but stable in size and appearance .\\nThe gray-white matter differentiation is preserved .\\nAgain seen are subtle hypodensities within the periventricular white matter which is an indication of chronic microvascular ischemic changes , stable .\\nExtensive carotid artery calcifications are identified .\\nThe visualized paranasal sinuses are clear .\\nThe surrounding osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable .\\nIMPRESSION :\\nNo evidence of acute or chronic infarction .\\nStable microvascular ischemic changes in the periventricular white matter .\\n8. 2017-09-30 EEG :\\nIMPRESSION :\\nAbnormal EEG due to the moderately slow posterior background and occasional bursts of generalized slowing .\\nThese findings indicate a widespread encephalopathic condition affecting both cortical and subcortical structures .\\nMedications , metabolic disturbances , and infection are among the most common causes .\\nNo prominent focal abnormalities were evident , and there were no epileptiform features .\\nThe cardiac monitor showed occasional irregularities in a PACED rhythm .\\nBrief Hospital Course :\\nA/P :\\n70 y/o male with h/o CAD , T2DM , hyperlipidemia , and COPD who presented to the Juan on 2017-09-03 with worsening SOB x 5 days from Morton Hospital & Medical Center .\\nPt. was initially admitted to CCU on 2017-09-03 , transferred to Pendleton on 2017-09-05 , triggered on 2017-09-10 for hypotension with BP 67/38 and transferred back to CCU on 2017-09-10 .\\nHe remained fluid overloaded and a swan catheter was placed .\\nThe following issues were addressed during this hospital admission :\\n1# Cardiac :\\nPump\\nThe patient was initially admitted for likely CHF exacerbation .\\nHe was started on a lasix gtt the night of admission with a good response .\\nHe continued to diurese and he was moved to the floor since he no longer required intensive level care .\\nWhile on the floor , he continued to be diuresed .\\nAfter several days , he became hypotensive and triggered for BPs 60s/30s .\\nHe was given IVF without an adequate response in his pressures .\\nHe was transferred back to the CCU and started on a dopamine gtt .\\nHe diuresed well on the dopamine gtt and his BP was supported .\\nGradually , the dopamine gtt was weaned .\\nHowever , he still appeared volume overloaded with minimal improvement in his oxygen requirement .\\nA swan was placed for a more accurate picture of his volume status and he was volume overloaded by swan numbers with an elevated PAD and elevated CVP without an obtainable wedge pressure .\\nHe also had a high CO and low SVR suggestive of sepsis , but he never had an elevated WBC and was afebrile during his entire hospital admission with negative blood , urine , wound , and pleural fluid cultures .\\nThe Lasix drip was eventually changed to IV Lasix boluses , with a net diuresis of over 36 liters for the hospital stay .\\nHe was then transitioned to oral Lasix for maintainence .\\nThe patient had an echo on 2017-09-04 with the results above in detail .\\nIt was unchanged in comparison to 2017-08-14 with similar ventricular function and inferior and inferolateral hypokinesis .\\nThe patient had another echo on 2017-09-14 with no new changes .\\nAt discharge the patient was thought to be euvolemic , satting well on room air and without peripheral edema .\\nHis dry weight is 70.4 kg .\\nIschemia\\nThe patient had an initial troponin bump on admission which was most likely secondary to CHF exacerbation .\\nHe was continued on Aspirin , Metoprolol and Lipitor with no further issues .\\nRhythm\\nThe patient is completely pacer-dependent , being epicardially paced at 70 .\\nHe is on Amiodarone for post-op afib and this was continued this entire admission .\\nHis underlying rhythm is atrial flutter ; it was unclear whether he had previously been cardioverted .\\nAnti-coagulation was started with Warfarin 5 mg with a goal of 2-3 and a plan for cardioversion in 6 weeks .\\nThe patient \\'s INR became supratherapeutic and Coumadin was held .\\nHis coumadin was transitioned to 2 mg and then 1 mg .\\nHis INR continued to flucuate .\\nHe was discharged on 1 mg , but a stable regimen had not been achieved .\\nHis INR will have to be monitored closely unitl his levels are stable .\\nHis INR goal is 02-24 .\\n2# SOB on admission :\\nLikely due to CHF exacerbation , with diuresis of over 36 L during his admission .\\nHe had 4 surgeries ( 3 cardiac surgeries ) earlier in the summer , so it is likely that he required copious IVF hydration surrounding these procedures which may have been the cause of his massive fluid overload .\\nIt appears that his diet was regulated at rehab but there is concern for medication non-compliance at rehab , per previous discharge summaries .\\nOn discharge , the patient was maintained on standing diuretics as well as PRN nebs and INH COPD meds .\\n3# Metabolic Alkalosis / Hypochloremia :\\nEtiology most likely a combination of contraction alkalosis and / or post-hypercapnia .\\nThis acutely worsened on 2017-09-18 , when the patient was found to have mental status changes and an ABG revealed a CO2 of over 100 , likley due to a depressed respiratory drive secondary to sedatives given for agitation on top of a preexisting alkalosis .\\nThe patient was therefore intubated for ventilation , and continued to be diuresed .\\nHis CO2 improved and he was extubated after a few days .\\nAll sedating medications were held and serial ABGs were trended to follow the resolution of the metabolic alkalosis .\\n4# Pleural effusions : s/p right thoracentesis on 2017-09-06 , 1600 mL of serosanguinous fluid removed from right pleural space .\\nGram stain and cultures were negative , cytology was negative .\\nThe right pleural effusion slowly re-accumulated after tap but resolved after continued diuresis .\\nRepeat CXR showed improvement of the effusion and on discharge he had been breathing well on room air without complications\\n5# T2DM :\\nThe patient was started on Glargine for tighter glycemic control and was covered with an insulin sliding scale .\\nHe was monitored with QID fingersticks .\\nHis blood sugars were in the 100s on discharge .\\n6# Hyperlipidemia :\\nThe patient was continued on his statin .\\n7# COPD :\\nThe patient was continued on nebs\\n8# MS changes :\\nThe patient has a history of baseline dementia which was confounded by delerium in the face of metabolic abnormalities .\\nHis mental status improved as his metabolic process was resolved as detailed above .\\nNeurology was also consulted and a head CT showed old lacunar infarcts but no acute causes for a change in mental status .\\nAn EEG showed mild encephalopathy , but no other findings .\\nHis mental status did clear somewhat with the addition of standing lactulose ; he was discharged on this medication .\\n9# Hypothyroidism :\\nThe patient was continued on his outpatient dose of Levothyroxine .\\n10# ? UTI :\\nThe patient was started on levofloxacin at Newton-Wellesley Hospital for a question of UTI based on U/A positive for WBC .\\nUCx during this hospitalization were negative and Levofloxacin was d/c \\'d .\\n11# Chronic lower back pain :\\nThe patient was treated with a Lidocaine patch and Percocet prn .\\nStronger narcotics were avoided given somnolence and MS changes .\\n12# Wound Care :\\nThe patient has left chest wound and left gluteal pressure ulcer .\\nWound care was consulted on 2017-09-05 and they made several recommendations .\\nFor the left gluteal pressure ulcer , they recommended gentle cleansing with normal saline or commercial wound cleaner , thin layer of Duoderm gel , air dry , allevyn foam adhesive over the site , and change every 2 days or prn .\\nFor the left chest wound , they recommended cleansing with commercial wound cleanser , pat dry , pack aquacel AG rope and moisten with saline , cover with dry gauze and change daily .\\nThese recommendations were followed throughout the admission .\\n13# Voiding :\\nPt. failed multiple attempts to void on his own .\\nCase was discussed with neurology .\\nHe was started on finsateride on the day prior to admission .\\nHe is scheduled to follow up with urology to address this issue .\\nUntil then , his foley should remain in place .\\n14# Code :\\nThe patient was full code during admission .\\nMedications on Admission :\\nLevothyroxine 100 mcg PO daily\\nDuloxetine 20 mg PO QHS\\nOndansetron PRN\\nPercocet 1 tab PRN\\nSenna PRN\\nColace PRN\\nLasix 80 mg PO BID\\nLactulose PRN\\nLidocaine patch\\nNystatin powder\\nGabapentin 300 mg PO TID\\nAlb nebs\\nFluticasone / Salmeterol\\nTiotropium Bromide\\nSpironolactone 25 mg PO daily\\nEpoetin 4000 units MWF\\nRISS\\nAmiodarone 200 mg PO daily\\nCalcium Acetate 667 mg PO TID\\nSubQ Heparin\\nPantoprazole 40 mg PO daily\\nSimvastatin 40 mg PO QHS\\nASA 81 mg PO daily\\nMVI\\nTylenol PRN\\nDischarge Medications :\\n1.

this was thought to be secondary to a more pervasive process , likely anoxic encephalopathy , for which the prognosis is extremely grim .\\nThis was discussed at length in several family meetings involving the patient 's wife , son , primary care doctor , ICU attending , and neurology consultant in the presence of a Asian interpreter .\\nThe end result of these discussion was that the patient 's wishes would not be consistent with this new level of functioning from which he had little hope of recovery ; the family decided to make him comfort measures only .\\nHe was disconnected from the ventilator and all medications beyond a morphine drip were stopped , and he expired shortly thereafter .\\nThe family was present .\\nMedications on Admission :\\nJevity 1.2 65 mL / hour continuous with water 240 cc q 8 hours\\nLasix 40 mg IV QAM ( given 08-14 )\\nVancomycin 1 gm IV q 36 hours ( last dose at 2000 on 08-13 ) .\\nStarted on 08-09 )\\nASA 325 mg PO QD\\nLansoprazole 30 mg PO QAM\\nHeparin 5000 units SC TID\\nZosyn 4.5 gm IV q 8 hours ( last dose on 08-14 at 1400 ) , started 08-08 .\\nMetoprolol 37.5 mg q 12 hours ( last dose 07/25 in AM )\\nProtein / Soy supplement 2 scoops q 12 hours\\nIpratropium / Albuterol inhaler 4 puffs QID\\nCompleted course of Flagyl 07-25 --> 08-10 .\\nDischarge Disposition :\\nExpired\\nDischarge Diagnosis :\\nAnoxic encephalopathy\\nAcute respiratory failure\\nChronic respiratory failure\\nPseudomonal pneumonia\\nVolume overload\\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease\\nBronchiectasis\\nHyponatremia\\nAnemia of chronic disease\\nSecondary :\\n1.

Hypotension - The patient was initially mildly hypotensive with systolic blood pressures in the 80s .\\nUpon admission it was unclear whether or not the patient was volume overloaded or volume depleted .\\nInitially he was treated with intravenous fluids with a dramatic response in his systolic blood pressure .\\nHowever , subsequent it was determined that the patient 's hypotension may have been related to his rapid ventricular response and right heart failure .\\nTherefore the focus of treatment was changed to controlling his rate .\\n2. Atrial fibrillation - The patient 's Digoxin had been weaned off prior to his admission .\\nIt was felt that this potentially had lead to his atrial flutter and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response .\\nThe patient was loaded once again with Digoxin and his beta blocker was increased to 100 mg of Lopressor , three times a day .\\nIn addition the patient was started on Verapamil since his heart rate had remained mildly tachycardiac in the low 100s .\\n3. Congestive heart failure - During the initial course of the patient 's admission , it was unclear as to whether or not he was volume overloaded or volume depleted .\\nThe patient was initially treated with intravenous fluids , however , subsequently he was diuresed when he became symptomatic and short of breath .\\nChest x-rays revealed evidence of congestive heart failure .\\nThe decision was made to have the patient undergo a cardiac catheterization to fully evaluate the hemodynamics to determine the etiology of the patient 's heart failure .\\nIn addition , plans were made to evaluate the patient 's cardiac arteries to determine if he had any component of ischemic cardiomyopathy .\\n4. Abnormal liver function tests - The patient had an isolated , elevated alkaline phosphatase with a confirmatory elevation in his gamma glutamyl transferase .\\nAn ultrasound of the right upper quadrant did not reveal any cholelithiasis or cholecystitis , however , an irregular hepatic contour was seen which is suggestive of underlying chronic liver disease .\\nThere was some concern that the patient may have a partial biliary obstruction and the patient was sent for an magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography to further evaluate the biliary system .\\nMagnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography did not reveal any evidence of biliary dilatation or of any obstructing pancreatic mass .\\nAgain seen was a slightly irregular contour of the liver with dilated hepatic veins suggesting chronic hepatic vascular congestion .\\nThe patient also revealed a prior history of heavy alcohol use for approximately 20 years , during the mid 1950s to mid 1970s .\\nIt was felt that he may have had some component of vascular congestion from his congestive heart failure as well as possibly some mild cirrhotic changes secondary to his previous alcohol use .\\n5. Fall - The patient had a mechanical fall during his admission .\\nHe did not sleep at all the night before and was extremely fatigued .\\nHe was walking in the hall , dragging his intravenous pole when he tripped over the foot of the pole and lost his balance .\\nHe fell backwards , landing on his buttocks and bumped his head .\\nHis neurological examination at that time was nonfocal and the head was atraumatic without any evidence of a hematoma .\\nA computerized axial tomography scan of his head at that time did not reveal any extra or intracranial hemorrhage .\\n6. Rectal bleeding - The patient has a history of rectal bleeding , ever since his brachytherapy for his prostate cancer .\\nThe patient has been treated with Argon laser therapy in the past for his rectal bleeding and it is recommended that he follow up with his gastroenterologist for repeat Argon laser therapy .\\nThe remainder of the hospital course will be dictated by the covering intern .\\nSheila Providence , M.D. 50-442\\nDictated By : Marjorie I.

arch of the aorta during the angiogram , was without sequelae .\\nShe was doing well with at least 4+ strength in all of her extremities , when on 11/13 , she had an acute drop in her systolic blood pressure to 70 for unclear reasons and without evidence of acute sepsis .\\nThis was accompanied by substantial decrement in neurologic function .\\nFor a short time , she seemed &quot; locked in &quot; .\\nShe has made slow progress since then and at the time of discharge has 4-strength at the left elbow and 4+ in the left wrist and hand .\\nTrace movement of the right elbow and 4-strength of the right wrist and hand .\\n4-to 4+ strength at the left ankle , 4+ strength at the right knee and right ankle .\\nShe is unable to lift either foot off the bed .\\nThe extra ocular movements are full .\\nTongue protrudes 4 cm .\\nShe is drowsy at times , but generally alert , responsive , interactive , able to talk in two to three word sentences when she wants to .\\nShe has severe memory deficits , but nevertheless , is able to engage in conversation , answers questions , names things well , does calculations and recognizes family members and states preferences .\\nShe has been working with Speech Therapy , occupational therapy and physical therapy closely and should continue to show improvement .\\nShe is anticoagulated on Coumadin and this has been stable .\\nShe is do not resuscitate in agreement with the wishes of her multiple family members .\\nFollow up computerized tomography scans and magnetic resonance imaging studies have shown infarction in bilateral basis pontis , mid brain , the superior cerebellar areas , left thalamus , bilateral temporal lobes medially and inferiorly and left posterior communicating artery .\\nThe patient had fevers sporadically during this hospitalization with rising white blood counts .\\nA chest X-ray documented a progressing left lower lobe infiltrate .\\nInitially this improved on Clindamycin and Cefotetan , but fevers recurred on this antibiotic regimen .\\nSputum grew out Klebsiella pneumoniae , and she was treated with Gentamicin and Ancef for 14 days intravenous ( bug being sensitive to these two drugs ) .\\nA left pleural effusion developed and this was tapped with ultrasound guidance , and found to be sterile , and without evidence of empyema .\\nThe patient is on Ciprofloxacin .\\nThe day of discharge is day #3 of 7 , after which antibiotics should be totally discontinued .\\nShe has developed bad thrush in this setting , she is not yet able to swallow and so she is on Nystatin swish and spit five times a day .\\nShe also gets Peridex to clean out her mouth .\\nOnce her liver enzymes are completely normal , a seven day course of Fluconazol may be helpful if the thrush is not spontaneously resolving off of antibiotics .\\nShe has been afebrile for greater than 10 days , including several days on oral antibiotics .\\nThe patient &apos;s liver enzymes were noted to be elevated mid way through her hospital course , to about three times normal , especially the SGOT and SGPT .\\nThese have spontaneously reversed , and are nearly normal at the time of discharge .\\nA right upper quadrant ultrasound documented gallstones , without evidence of common bile duct dilatation or active cholecystitis .\\nThe exact cause of her liver enzyme elevation is unclear , but we are being careful about administering drugs , which might irritate the liver .\\nThe patient had a steady decline in her hematocrit during this hospitalization .\\nIron studies are all entirely normal , her anemia is attributed to anemia or chronic disease with hypoproliferation as well as multiple phlebotomies .\\nThe plan is to give her folic acid , but not iron .\\nThe patient &apos;s potassiums have been repeatedly low and require daily checks and repletion .\\nThis is thought due to the extensive course of Gentamicin which she received .\\nThis must be carefully checked despite the standing order for potassium .\\nThe patient has had low sodiums during this hospitalization .\\nThis may due to her central nervous system process or her pulmonary process , with fluids administered as described , she should not have any problems from this .\\nHer sodiums were never below 130 .\\nShe does well with tube feeds .\\nHer tube feeds orders are as follow :\\nfull strength Replete with fiber at 70 cc. per hour .\\nIn addition , the patient gets 250 cc. of juice ( not water ) three times a day .\\nShe also gets Lactinex granules three packages in each bottle of tube feeds .\\nShe also gets Metamucil one teaspoon with the first bolus of juice each day .\\nPlease note that evaluation by the swallowing therapist , showed that the patient is aspirating at this time , but there is great hope from the nature of her deficit and the good movements of her tongue that normal swallowing should return soon .\\nIt is for this reason that she is discharged with an nasogastric tube and that no plans for G tube placement are made at this time .\\nShe has a history of of angina without myocardial infarction that has not been worked up .\\nShe did have brief chest pain twice during this admission that did not correlate with electrocardiogram changes .\\nIn the first week of November , her electrocardiogram showed T wave inversions in the lateral leads , correlating with an increase in the LDH , but not CK .\\nThis did not normalize with administration of Isordil and the patient denied chest pain at this time .\\nAs of 4/7 , her electrocardiogram had reverted back to normal and there is no evidence of congestive heart failure or continued electrocardiogram changes , and chest pain is absent .\\nHer cholesterol was 350 here .\\nShe has been off of her hypercholesterol medicines .\\nThese can be restarted when it is deemed reasonable , in view of her acute disease and recently elevated liver enzymes .\\nNote that the liver enzymes were normal on admission , at which time she was taking all of the above cholesterol medicines .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nMetamucil 1 teaspoon q.d. , with first bolus of juice , juice 250 cc. down nasogastric tube t.i.d. , tube feeds as above , Lactinex as above , Tagamet 800 mg. nasogastric tube qhs , Nystatin swish and spit 10 cc. five times a day , Cardizem slow release 90 mg.

had to catch her from falling down &quot; as she toppled towards the right .\\nShe evidently recovered from the episode after a number of minutes .\\nThe following day , she remained in bed through essentially all of the day due to malaise with no specific deficits being noted .\\nIn the subsequent two days , she had several small spells of &quot; imbalance &quot; , particularly towards the right , and other symptoms included diffuse and mainly frontal headaches and mild neck soreness .\\nThere was no diplopia , visual loss , speech abnormality or sensory change in her history .\\nShe was initially evaluated at an outside hospital emergency room , and then transferred to Well General Hospital .\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\nIs notable for depression , and she has been followed regularly by Dr. Freiermchird of Nash Health for several months with pharmacologic treatment , which is apparently working well .\\nHer Doxepin has recently been increased .\\nShe is status post appendectomy and otherwise has no remarkable past medical history .\\nALLERGIES :\\nQuinine gives her a rash .\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\\nThe only medications she is on are Paxil 30 mg p.o. q.day , Doxepin 25 mg p.o. q.day , and Klonopin 2 mg p.o. q.h.s.\\nSOCIAL HISTORY :\\nShe is currently unemployed , but until recently , she was employed at a bank .\\nShe was born and raised in Atonlaremont Rockpo .\\nThere is a history of childhood abuse .\\nShe does not drink .\\nShe is a former tobacco user and takes no illicit drugs .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nShe was pleasant , in no acute distress ;

there were some older hematomas in the bilaterally shins .\\nMental status - her speech was fluent without errors .\\nHer affect was slightly inappropriate at times ; for example , singing or humming along while performing some of the motor tasks and giving the impression of indifference to the deficits that were demonstrated on the examination .\\nHer memory was fully intact for short-term recollection of three out of three objects at five minutes with excellent naming , repetition , proverb interpretation , and ability to follow commands .\\nVisual fields were full to confrontation .\\nHer left pupil was 7 mm reacting to 5 mm .\\nHer right pupil was 5.5 mm reacting to 4 mm .\\nHer extraocular movements were intact for horizontal and vertical pursuits .\\nThere was no nystagmus and no ptosis .\\nHer saccades were normal .\\nFacial strength and sensation were full and symmetric .\\nHer tongue , uvula and palate were midline .\\nShoulder shrug was 5/5 power .\\nMotor examination revealed 5/5 power in all groups in the proximal and distal upper and lower extremities .\\nThere was no drift .\\nThere was normal bulk and tone .\\nShe had slightly slow fine finger motility approximately equal bilaterally , although this was extremely difficult to reproduce .\\nSensory - intact light touch , temperature , and vibration overall .\\nReflexes were 2+ throughout in the upper and lower extremities , and toes were downgoing .\\nThere was no jaw jerk and no Hoffman &apos;s sign .\\nCoordination - toe tap was slow bilaterally , although difficult to reproduce , and at best , was essentially within normal limits .\\nOn standing , she tended to fall to the front , back or sides without trying to stop her fall initially , and extensive gait testing was deferred due to concerns for safety .\\nHer heel-to-shin and finger-to-nose testing was fully intact bilaterally without ataxia or tremor .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nWere unremarkable with normal electrolytes and complete blood count parameters .\\nHer erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 12 .\\nHer coagulation parameters were normal .\\nHead CT scan without contrast showed normal brain parenchyma and no intracranial process .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :\\nThe patient was admitted for her gait disorder with other notable findings on examination including anisocoria , which , by the patient &apos;s report , had been noted several months earlier .\\nA magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance angiogram study was obtained , which showed no clear evidence of arterial dissections or infarction or other pathologic processes .\\nShe had been placed on heparin initially , but this was discontinued after the magnetic resonance imaging results were obtained .\\nPosterior transcranial Doppler studies showed normal studies of both vertebral arteries , and carotid non-invasive studies showed normal right and left carotid bifurcations .\\nOn the second hospital day , her gait continued to be markedly unstable , although with no consistent pattern in terms of weakness or directionality of falling , and she continued to have no reproducible upper extremity or lower extremity ataxia or dysmetria .\\nShe was seen by the Psychiatry Service .\\nShe was not felt to be acutely suicidal or otherwise in need of acute psychiatric treatment .\\nThe psychiatrist also noted the indifference the patient evinced regarding her own symptomatology .\\nThe patient was evaluated in one of the neurology conferences for several hours , and during this time , showed significant improvement while receiving gait training as well as evaluation ; in particular , she became more stable with counter-balancing methods .\\nThis trend of improvement continued , and she was discharged in stable condition .\\nShe will follow up with her psychiatrist , Dr. Freiermchird ( Sone Memorial Hospital ) on a regular basis , and she can follow up with the Neurology Service on a p.r.n. basis if needed .\\nShe will continue on her previous outpatient medical regimen .\\nNIREGE MEMORY , M.D.\\nTR :\\nbzo\\nDD :\\n03/29/97\\nTD :\\n03/31/97 12:36 P\\ncc :\\nNYRI A MEMORY , M.D.\\nASHELLRIETTE NESSASU THREATSVOT , M.D.\\nEJEAN NADARC FREIERMCHIRD , M.D.\\n'),\n",

:\\n02/18/1991\\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSES :\\n1) ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY SYNDROME .\\n2) PNEUMOCYSTIS CARINII PNEUMONIA .\\n3) ADULT RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nMr. Breutzfarstxei is a 30 year old man with recently diagnosed acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia who presented with pneumonia , developed adult respiratory distress syndrome , and died in the hospital after failed efforts of ventilatory support .\\nMr. Breutzfarstxei was recently diagnosed with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome when he had Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia on 01/17/91 .\\nHe was admitted to the Retelk County Medical Center at that time and was treated with Bactrim and steroids .\\nHe was actually intubated and underwent bronchoscopy where the diagnosis was made with a positive toluidine blue study .\\nHe initially did well after extubation and completed approximately two weeks of Bactrim and a steroid taper .\\nAt discharge after about two weeks post-extubation , he had an O2 saturation of approximately 95% on room air .\\nHe was seen by Dr. Seen and Dr. Seen as an out-patient .\\nOn 02/06/91 , he was seen in FLFDMC and at that point , his temperature was noted to be 101.4 and he had malaise and diarrhea .\\nHe was evaluated in the Emergency Room .\\nAt that time , his oxygen saturation was only 90% on room air and his chest X-Ray showed no change .\\nCultures were taken and he was sent out .\\nOn 02/08/91 , the patient called Dr. Seen because of increased shortness of breath and malaise .\\nHe was seen in FLFDMC where he was noted to have jaundice and newly palpable liver edge .\\nReview of liver function tests revealed a cholestatic picture which was not previously found and it was felt that this was secondary to the Bactrim which had been recently stopped anyway .\\nHis oxygen saturation at that time was only 86% on room air and he was admitted .\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\n1) HIV positive with a CD4 count of 74 .\\n2) Recent PCP .\\n3) Status post right elbow surgery .\\n4) Venereal disease history .\\n5) PPD anergic .\\nThe patient &apos;s HIV risk factors include history of intravenous drug abuse , prostitution , and a former prisoner .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nOn presentation , the patient was a young appearing Hispanic male in mild respiratory distress with a blood pressure of 140/90 , heart rate 120 , respirations 32 , and temperature 101 .\\nSKIN :\\nJaundiced .\\nHEENT :\\nRevealed icteric sclerae , the oropharynx with extensive thrush , and an ulcer under his tongue .\\nNECK :\\nHe had no cervical adenopathy and his neck was supple .\\nLUNGS :\\nHad tubular breath sounds especially in the lower lung fields .\\nCARDIAC :\\nShowed regular rate and rhythm without murmurs , rubs , or gallops .\\nThere was no costovertebral angle tenderness .\\nABDOMEN :\\nSoft with bowel sounds and there was mid epigastric and right upper quadrant tenderness .\\nHis liver was 10 cm and was felt three finger breadths below the costal margin .\\nHis spleen was not palpable .\\nRECTAL :\\nHe had guaiac positive stools .\\nEXTREMITIES :\\nUnremarkable .\\nGENITOURINARY :\\nHis penis had a 1/2 cm ulcer with yellowish discharge .\\nNEUROLOGICAL :\\nNon-focal .\\nLABORATORY EXAMINATION :\\nOn admission , white count was 7.2 with 57% neutrophils , 40% lymphocytes , l mononuclear cell , and 1.6 eosinophils .\\nPT was 12.6 and PTT was 29 .\\nSodium was 133 , potassium was 4.2 , chloride 100 , CO2 19 , BUN 21 , creatinine 1.2 , and glucose 122 .\\nALT was 181 , AST was 156 , LDH was 336 , alkaline phosphatase was 214 , and bilirubin was 12.7 total .\\n( On 02/06 , his bilirubin had been 7.2 with 6 direct ) .\\nHis arterial blood gas on 50% was pO2 92 , pCO2 24 , and pH 7.46 .\\nHis chest X-Ray showed bilateral nodular infiltrates .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nThe patient was admitted for work-up of his cholestatic jaundice picture along with work-up for his pulmonary process and treatment of both .\\nIn terms of pulmonary function , it was felt that one possibility was that the patient was a Bactrim failure for PCP although this was unusual .\\nHe was started on Pentamidine , especially in light of the fact that it was felt that his liver function tests were due possibly to Bactrim .\\nThe patient was also covered with Erythromycin and Gentamicin for coverage of community acquired pneumonias and gram negative rods .\\nHe was given supplemental oxygen .\\nIn terms of his liver abnormalities , it was felt that viral hepatitis was in the differential as well as several opportunistic infections of the liver but also was felt that Bactrim could be a cause of these abnormalities .\\nTiters for CMV and Epstein-Barr virus were sent and a titer for toxoplasma was sent .\\nStool was sent for ova and parasites .\\nGastrointestinal was consulted .\\nInitially , the patient did well in terms of his pre-status and required less oxygen .\\nHowever , on 02/10/91 , his respiratory rate increased and his oxygen saturation decreased .\\nActually in reviewing the records at this point , it appears that Pentamidine was not started initially so on the antibiotics of Erythromycin and Gentamicin , the patient &apos;s respiratory status worsened and his LDH climbed so he began Pentamidine on 02/10/91 .\\nOn 02/11/91 , the patient again appeared more comfortable this time with 50% facemask but then required more oxygen , dropped his O2 saturations , and was intubated on 02/11/91 .\\nHe was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit on 12/12/90 on Gentamicin , Vancomycin , Pentamidine , and Prednisone .\\nAlso of note at that point , hepatitis C virus serologies had come back positive .\\nHowever , at this point , his liver function test abnormalities appeared more consistent with a cholestatic picture with his direct bilirubin being 12.1 and total being 14.1 .\\nThe patient &apos;s abdominal CT scan showed no liver disease and no obstruction .\\nThe patient &apos;s liver function tests appeared to improve .\\nThe patient &apos;s penile ulcer was cultured and grew positive herpes simplex virus and the patient was started on Acyclovir .\\nOn 02/13/91 , the patient had a bronchoalveolar lavage performed which showed a toluidine blue with many pneumocysts noted .\\nNo other cultures grew out and the patient &apos;s clinical status deteriorated .\\nThe patient required 100% oxygen to maintain adequate oxygen saturations on the ventilator .\\nHe required elevated ventilatory pressures with PIPS often above 60 .\\nFortunately , no evidence of baratroma was ever discerned .\\nHowever , the patient &apos;s respiratory status continued to decline and we were unable to maintain oxygen saturations above 80% even using reverse I to E ventilation , paralysis , sedation , and other modes of ventilation .\\nPatient underwent liver biopsy on 02/16/91 and the results of this were pending when the patient died .\\nThe patient actually developed decreasing counts with white count as low as 1.75 , hematocrit as low as 26 , and platelets as low as 68 noted on 02/15/91 .\\nThese were supported with blood products and Hematology was consulted .\\nThey felt that it was most likely secondary to Bactrim and these actually were getting better when the patient died .\\nBone marrow biopsy was not attempted .\\nDiscussions were begun with the family regarding limits of supportive care .\\nDue to continued worsening pulmonary status and an overall grim prognosis , the family decided , in consultation with the Medical Team , to withdraw ventilatory support .\\nThis was done on the evening of 02/18/91 .\\nPatient expired after the endotracheal tube was withdrawn at 6:40 p.m.\\nDISPOSITION :\\nThe patient died in hospital .\\nAn autopsy will be performed .\\nAn autopsy was performed as per the family &apos;s wishes .\\nWE221/9850 TAKO C.

Gastrointestinal .\\nThe patient had an elevated bilirubin on admission with decreased output of biliary drain .\\nThe drain was replaced over the wire , 8-10 by IR , when it was accidentally removed .\\nIncreased flow again .\\nThe patient had signs and symptoms develop of SBP , also with an elevated white count .\\nHe was treated broadly with amp , levo and Flagyl .\\nCultures were negative and onlyon one gram stain did it show rare gram negative rods .\\nThe patient &apos;s abdominal fluid cell counts showed 2400 white blood cells , 500 red cells with 82 polyps , 11 lymphs , 7 monos .\\nClinically , this was consistent with SBP , although unfortunately , fluid was never sent for cytology and a lot of those white cells are most likely due to his cancer .\\nHe underwent abdominal paracentesis approximately two times a week for therapeutic .\\nThis had to be performed by IR because the pocket was too deep to access from the bedside .\\nHe received a two week course of broad spectrum antibiotics and will be maintained on Levofloxacin IV for prophylaxis against SBP .\\n2. Pulmonary .\\nFrom a pulmonary standpoint , he continued to complain of shortness of breath .\\nHis apical pneumothorax from the outside hospital had resolved .\\nChest xray was consistent with pleurodesis .\\nHowever , with persistent abdomen distention , there is likely restrictive deficit and , in addition , after each tap , he at times became hypotensive and with some mild fluid resuscitation decompensated with pulmonary edema , requiring both albumin and Lasix to try to mobilize third space fluids .\\nOn the day of discharge , he is stating approximately 91 to 92% on three to four liters .\\nChest xray is still consistent with volume overload .\\nThe plan will be to continue to try to alternate albumin and Lasix to mobilize his fluid .\\n3. Cardiovascular .\\nHe had episodes of bradycardia without subsequent fall in blood pressure at the beginning of his admission .\\nHe was ruled out for a myocardial infarction .\\nEchocardiogram showed 50% ejection fraction with mild mitral regurgitation .\\nHe did not show any episodes of bradycardia throughout the remainder of his hospital course .\\n4.

Heme .\\nFrom a heme standpoint , he presented anemic and with an elevated PT INR .\\nHe required a few transfusions during his hospital course .\\nHe also required FFP initially to reverse his coagulopathy .\\nHowever , this resolved on its own over the hospital course .\\nHis INR normalized , however , unfortunately , he developed bilateral deep venous thromboses during his hospital course and will be maintained on Lovenox .\\n6. Renal .\\nHe had a creatinine of 4.0 on admission and this decreased down to the mid ones with fluid , currently at 1.7 on discharge .\\nFrom his urinalysis , he has mostly a prerenal state .\\nHowever , he does require diuresis to prevent increased volume overload in his lungs from his hypoalbunemic state .\\nAt the time , Nutrition was following , initially with a low fat , low cholesterol , low sugar diet .\\nHis appetite is decreasing somewhat as his disease process progresses , therefore , we have liberalized his diet for him to take what he wishes .\\n7.

NUTRITIONAL STATUS .\\n7) THROMBOCYTOPENIA STATUS POST BONE MARROW TRANSPLANT .\\n8) MULTIPLE MYELOMA .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nThis is a 59-year-old white male .\\nThe patient has had multiple myeloma since 1990 .\\nHe underwent an autologous bone marrow transplant in 10/92 at Petersly Hospital And Medical Center .\\nAt that time he received total body irradiation of 1400 cGy .\\nThis bone marrow transplant did not produce remission and then he was treated with three cycles of VAD subsequently .\\nIn 08/94 , the patient developed lower back pain .\\nA workup done in DE is not available at the time of this dictation .\\nAccording to her scanty records , an MRI of the spine showed diffuse spinal column involvement with lesions in T4 and T8 with no cord compression at that time .\\nHe was then treated with radiation therapy from T3 to T9 receiving 2500 cGy from 08/94 to 09/94 .\\nHe has been on Decadron since 08/94 .\\nAbout two weeks prior to admission the patient developed mid back pain , burning in nature with radiation around the right lower ribs .\\nHe also began to develop noticeably increasing bilateral lower extremity weakness and possibly numbness in the lower extremities .\\nHe stated that he had difficulty rising from a chair .\\nAn MRI without gadolinium done on 11/20/94 of the spine showed a right posterior lateral epidural mass extending from T9 to T12 .\\nThere was evidence of cord compression .\\nThe patient &apos;s Decadron dose was increased to 12 mg q day and he was also started on MS Contin and radiation therapy was being planned and arranged at the Petersly Hospital And Medical Center .\\nHowever , one day prior to admission the patient developed right lower extremity pain and could not walk secondary to the pain .\\nOver the next 12 hours while in transit to the hospital , the patient &apos;s right lower extremity became red , swollen , and increasingly painful .\\nHe has had chronic bilateral lower extremity swelling since his transplant but the right lower extremity swelling was noticeably increased .\\nHe also complained of some fecal incontinence the day prior to admission without urinary incontinence .\\nAt the time of presentation the patient denied headache , arm weakness , changes in vision , dysarthria , abdominal pain , nausea or vomiting , chest pain or shortness of breath .\\nHe was taken to Huyychestleme Health Of in Scoo , Utah where he had a temperature of 99.9 , blood pressure 90/50 , heart rate 128 , and O2 sat of 91% on room air .\\nBlood cultures , urine culture , and UA were all done .\\nBlood cultures drawn on admission subsequently grew Pseudomonas aeruginosa .\\nHe was treated with Ceftazidime , gentamicin , and Vancomycin and also was started on a Dopamine drip for treatment of his sepsis .\\nA Swan was placed and initial readings were CVP of 6 , wedge pressure of 10 to 12 , cardiac index of 4.7 , and SVR of 438 all consistent with a Pseudomonas sepsis picture .\\nHe was given stress steroids and was subsequently transferred to Lorough Medical Center &apos;s Intensive Care Unit for further management .\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\n1) Multiple myeloma .\\n2) Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation .\\n3) Plasmacytoma of T9 through T12 .\\n4) Chronic renal insufficiency .\\n5) Chronically low platelet count .\\n6) Failed autologous bone marrow transplant in 10/92 .\\n7) Hypothyroidism .\\nFAMILY HISTORY :\\nPositive for diabetes mellitus .\\nSOCIAL HISTORY :\\nMarried to a very supportive wife .\\nALLERGIES :\\nQuestion of penicillin and sulfa drugs leading to a rash .\\nMEDICATIONS :\\nOn transfer include Vancomycin , Ceftazidime , gentamicin , Solu Cortef 100 mg q8h , Lasix , Synthroid , insulin , MS Contin 60 mg b.i.d. , MSO4 2 mg p.r.n. pain IV , Dopamine 12 mcg per minute .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nOn admission showed a non-toxic appearing male with temperature 99.5 , blood pressure 82/50 , heart rate 118 , respiratory rate 15 .\\nHEENT exam atraumatic , no oral lesions .\\nNeck supple , carotids without bruits .\\nCardiac exam was regular S1 and S2 , no murmur .\\nChest clear to auscultation with a few fine crackles at the left base .\\nAbdomen non-distended , positive bowel sounds , soft , non-tender , no hepatosplenomegaly or masses .\\nRectal normal tone , guaiac positive brown stool , no perirectal lesions or erythema .\\nExtremities reveal the right lower extremity was tense , purple-red , swollen , and was warm from the knee to the ankle and extremely tender .\\nThere was pitting edema of both lower extremities but no evidence of cellulitis of the left lower extremity .\\nNeurological exam on admission revealed he was drowsy but easily arousable to voice , oriented to person , Retelk County Medical Center , and date , able to say no but mildly inattentive during examination .\\nCranial nerves intact .\\nMotor exam normal tone , positive asterixis , no drift .\\nStrength was decreased in both lower extremities .\\nCoordination was normal with good finger to nose , gait was not tested .\\nDeep tendon reflexes were 2+ in the upper extremities , 1+ in the patella reflexes , no reflexes at the ankles , upgoing Babinski toes bilaterally .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nOn admission revealed white blood cell count 4.2 , Hct 27 , platelet count 28 .\\nGlucose 191 .\\nPT 17.6 , PTT 48.7 , fibrinogen 686 , TT 39.2 .\\nMagnesium 1.7 .\\nUA showed no white blood cells , positive granular casts .\\nChest x-ray was without infiltrates , wand in good position .\\nAn MRI was performed upon admission and showed an epidural mass at the right posterior lateral T9 to T12 area invading the neural foramina .\\nThere was no CSF density .\\nThese findings were consistent with the cord compression .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nBy problems -\\n1) INFECTIOUS DISEASE / CELLULITIS :\\nThe patient &apos;s clinical situation was most consistent with a Pseudomonas cellulitis and subsequent sepsis .\\nBlood cultures drawn at the outside hospital grew out Pseudomonas that was sensitive to Imipenem and Tobramycin .\\nThere were cultures obtained seeping from the wound at Retelk County Medical Center and those also grew out Pseudomonas aeruginosa .\\nThe organism grown at this institution was sensitive to Imipenem , Ceftazidime , Amikacin , gentamicin , Ciprofloxacin , Tobramycin but was resistant to Cefotetan , Ceftriaxone , Mezlocillin , Bactrim , Ampicillin , chloramphenicol , and sulbactam .\\nHe was treated initially with Ceftazidime and gentamicin but there was a question about the organism &apos;s susceptibility from lab studies done at the outside hospital .\\nHe was subsequently switched to Imipenem and Tobramycin and was maintained on those medications throughout the hospital course .\\nThe Tobramycin and Imipenem were started on 11/25/94 .\\nIn addition , the patient received a five day course of intravenous IgG to improve infection control .\\nVancomycin was also added to his regimen on 11/28/94 and this was primarily to provide improved MRSA coverage as he continued to have erythema along the lateral right lower extremity .\\nHe was evaluated by the Surgery Department and it is there feeling that there is no indication for surgical intervention / amputation at this time .\\nHe is being maintained with twice daily Xeroform with Betadine changes .\\nThese dressing changes are applied by applying the Xeroform on Betadine initially and then changing it with sterile dry bandages .\\nOf note , the patient has extreme pain with these dressing changes and requires parenteral morphine sulfate for pain control during dressing changes .\\nThe plan is to complete a full course of Imipenem and Tobramycin for his Pseudomonas cellulitis .\\nAs mentioned earlier he continues to have erythema tracking up his leg and up to his lateral thigh .\\nThe cause of this erythema is not know at this time but has not shown extensive progression .\\n2) CARDIOVASCULAR :\\nThe patient was initially treated with Dopamine which was subsequently weaned off after his sepsis improved .\\nHe was noted to be in rapid AF on several episodes receiving 5 mg IV Lopressor each time with improvement .\\nHe has been in and out of atrial fibrillation and normal sinus rhythm .\\nAn echocardiogram performed at the outside hospital while he was septic showed decreased global EF .\\nThe patient is being maintained on Digoxin for his paroxysmal atrial fibrillation .\\nHe has had no significant episode of tachycardia or blood pressure alteration during the final days of hospitalization .\\nThe plan is to continue the Digoxin and to recheck an echocardiogram to assess his ejection fraction when he is clinically better .\\n3) ONCOLOGY :\\nThe patient has a plasmacytoma affecting the spine .\\nHe has been receiving radiation therapy to that area during the hospital stay .\\nThe plan is to complete a full course of XRT to the spinal region for the plasmacytoma .\\nThe patient &apos;s lesion compressing his thoracic spine was never biopsied , however , the MRI appearance does not seem to be infectious and is most consistent with plasmacytoma for which he is receiving the radiation therapy .\\n4) NEUROLOGIC :\\nAs mentioned above he has a cord compression and is on steroids .\\nHe was initially treated with IV Decadron 10 mg up front and then 6 mg q6h.\\nHis neurological exam remained stable with no evidence of increasing lower extremity edema .\\nHis Decadron dose was titrated down to 5 mg IV q6h on 12/3/94 .\\nHis Decadron dose will be slowly titrated down over time following his neurological exam closely .\\n5) BLOOD SUGARS :\\nThe patient has steroid induced diabetes mellitus .\\nHe has been on increasing doses of insulin receiving NPH in the morning and night in addition to a CZI sliding scale on a q6h basis .\\nThe plan is to continue the supplemental insulin while he is on steroids and while his sugars remain high .\\n6) RESPIRATORY :\\nHe initially required a face mask to keep his saturation above 90% .\\nHowever , with increasing diuresis and improving septic pictures his O2 saturations have improved and he is now on nasal cannula and will be maintained on nasal cannula to keep his sat above 93% .\\nHe can be given intravenous Lasix as needed for any evidence of respiratory compromise or increasing pulmonary edema .\\n7) NUTRITION :\\nThe patient has a poor nutritional status with hypoalbuminemia .\\nHe has been maintained on tube feeds and that should be continued .\\nHe should also be encouraged to eat as much as possible orally in addition to this tube feeds and aspiration precaution should be maintained .\\n8) ELEVATED PT and PTT :\\nBoth of these responded to three day course of vitamin K 10 mg each day .\\nHis PT and PTT are now normal , however , he continues to run a low platelet count .\\nThis has been evident since the time of his bone marrow transplant .\\nWe have been transfusing him with platelets to keep his counts above 20,000 to reduce his bleeding risk .\\nHe also received several blood transfusions while here to maintain his Hct around 30 .\\nThrombocytopenic inducing drugs should be avoided if possible on this patient .\\nDISPOSITION :\\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :\\nTylenol 650 mg po q4h p.r.n. , Dulcolax 10 mg per rectum b.i.d. p.r.n. , Decadron 5 mg IV q6h , Digoxin 0.25

acidosis .\\nHe was given blood transfusion , two units when his hematocrit dropped to 29.4 .\\nAfter transfusion , the patient &apos;s hematocrit rose to 37.7 on the day of discharge .\\nThe patient was also given sodium bicarbonate to correct his metabolic acidosis .\\nHe continued to pass about 1500-2000 cc of urine a day and his renal function improved slowly with creatinine decreased to 4.2 on the day of discharge .\\nDuring this admission , the patient also developed atrial fibrillation with ventricular rate of about 70-80 .\\nCPK was tracked , but was totally normal .\\nNo beta blockers were given .\\nA long discussion amongst the specialist , nephrology , urology , interventional radiology , primary oncology as well with the family lead to the conclusion that conservative management may give the patient more comfort than crisis treatment in this well advanced prostate CA .\\nDr. Lucreamull discussed the patient &apos;s clinical status and overall situation with the patient &apos;s family and the family decided that Mr. Prehekote could return home with hospice .\\nThe patient &apos;s primary care physician , Dr. Tomedankell Flowayles will manage the hospice
